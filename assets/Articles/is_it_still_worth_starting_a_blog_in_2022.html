  I don't know about you but I could never get another job to have this lifestyle. With this kind of income and with the blogging business the sky is the limit.
<br><br>
You are asking yourself what if all niches are saturated? Will I make any money with my blog or I will just invest hours and hours of work with no results in my bank account? Well, I know you're asking yourself these questions. Because I've been in your shoes just a few years ago. I was looking up at some bloggers who replaced their day job with blogging income in just two or three years. And I was convinced that they were lucky to get into this business early and that I was too late for the party. I know exactly what you're thinking and here. I am making an average of over $30,000 monthly with my blog in the best months reaching about $40,000 in revenue. My business expenses are still very low. it's a business with the highest ROI you can imagine and I do this while working from home.

<br><br>I don't know about you but I could never get another job to have this lifestyle. With this kind of income and with the blogging business, the sky is the limit. I will show you later in this post all the details about the different income streams that I use to monetize my blog but for now.<strong> I hope that I can show you that blogging is worth your time.</strong>
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  Choose the right blogging niche!
</h2>
<p>
  I tried to make all the information easy to digest for you and I laid out a step-by-step plan for you to get your first $1000 monthly. I will tell you how to get this time for free. The first thing you need to do when starting a blog is to decide which topics you'll be blogging about. In other words, what will be your niche so pick a niche for your blog. Beginners often make a mistake thinking about niches It's easy to start a blog about whatever your experience in life is or about your hobbies and not give a thought about whether or not this is a profitable topic. If you plan to make money with your blog I recommend you explore the most profitable blogging niches for this year.

  <br><br>Choose your main promoting platform!
  <br><br>if you want to use a particular platform to drive traffic to your blog for example. You want to start with Pinterest but you need to keep in mind that not all the niches do equally well with the Pinterest audience.

  <br><br>It's a mostly female audience so the niches that do great on Pinterest would be home decor and DIY recipes quarantine diet and weight loss lifestyle beauty and fashion relationship advice. If you're not sure about a specific niche Pinterest is the platform that is not looking for narrow niche websites as Google does. You can have a broad lifestyle blog and take all the advantages from printrest.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  Choose your blogging domain name(That will skyrocket your site!)
</h2>
<p>
  The common-sense rules that you should keep in mind when you're searching for a domain name.

  <br><br>First, it should be short and easy to remember, second avoid using numbers and hyphens in the domain name, and always try to get a domain.com zone in the worst-case scenario you can settle to a domain. co so anything like .net or .live is a bad idea for many reasons.

  <br><br>Don't use weirdly spelled or misspelled words in your domain, Just because the keyword that you wanted is not available as a domain wrong spelling will always confuse people. And they will end up on your competitor's site. Generally, I think that people tend to overthink the step of choosing the main name you can simply pick your full name if it's not a very popular name. Under your name, you can blog about anything and you can switch the niche easily at any time. The first step is technically starting your blog once you have an idea about your domain name you can go ahead and register your blog the process will take you about 10 minutes
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  Right content management system!
</h2>
<p>
  For content management system, for this, I highly recommend you to stick with WordPress. It's the most suitable for a blogging website needs and the second thing to choose is a hosting provider.

  <br><br>Make your blog a WordPress theme so the way your blog looks depends on your WordPress theme. There are lots of options out there some are completely free. If you wanna try the free theme I would recommend you to check first Astra theme. And if you want to start with a premium theme right away.

</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  Drive traffic to your site!
</h2>
<br><br>
<h3> Pinterest</h3>
<p>
  When it comes to getting visitors to your website I recommend you focus on one platform at a time. Otherwise, you will spread to think a lot. Start with Pinterest because this platform can give you traffic fast for some niches Pinterest doesn't work and in that case, your first option would be Google. Might have low traffic potential on Pinterest, because the majority of this platform are women so again my top list of the platform starts with Pinterest. You can get your first traffic spikes with Pinterest within a few months, while with Google you might need to wait at least six months or even a year. With Pinterest, it doesn't matter if you have an old domain name and whether or not it has a domain authority it works great for almost any niche.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
Search Engine Optimization SEO
</h3>
   <p>
    My second favorite traffic source is Google SEO or search engine migration for Google search traffic. It's more stable because it doesn't have the viral effect that you can see on Pinterest. It's good that Google traffic is more stable but it takes so much more time and effort to make Google SEO work on a brand new website. You might need to wait about six months or even a year before seeing any significant traffic. By waiting I don't mean just starting a blog and doing nothing. I mean that you will be working hard optimizing your site and writing content.

<br><br>Optimized for keywords and building backlinks to your site and the next one after Google comes YouTube. Probably you realize that Google owns YouTube so you can often rank your videos higher than your blog post for the same keyword.
   </p> 
<br><br>
<h3>
  Social Networks
</h3>
<p>
  You have to pay for ads to get some traffic from the social networks. I assume that you're starting a blog to make money not to spend your money on ads before you ever make a cent out of your blog. I could tell you so much more about Instagram but all of it would be about how you cannot get traffic from Instagram to your website. I don't want to waste your time on all these arguments just trust me on this.

<br><br>I'm going to start talking about monetization methods for your blog. But if you find the information that I shared so far useful then feel free to subscribe to our newsletter.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  Monetize your blog!
</h2>
<p>
  Let me show you what could be your monetization strategy as a beginner Blogger and how you can change it over time. Most bloggers start adding display ads from Google AdSense or media.net.Only because it's the easiest thing you can do with the new website. Usually, it's enough to have about 20 posts on your blog. Something that a lot of people don't know about is that you need to have a privacy policy page before you apply to Google AdSense. If you ask my honest opinion I don't think you should even bother applying to AdSense when you have a very low traffic, because they pay so little for every thousand visitors when all of your traffic is just a couple of hundreds or maybe 1000 visitors a month, you will be earning less than $10 a month.

<br><br>It's not worth sending your small audience away for so little money. My top recommendation for beginner bloggers is to find affiliate products that you can promote in your niche.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
  Affiliate marketing
</h3>
<p>
  Work with affiliate networks like Amazon affiliates ShareASale and many others and depending on your niche you could even partner directly with some product sellers. Some products can cost a few hundreds of dollars and can come with a great commission something like 50%, in this case, you could be making a hundred dollars or even more for a sale. If you have content linked to an affiliate product like this is convincing enough that even with a small traffic volume you will be able to make your first $1000 on your blog. With good offers when your blog gets at least 10,000 monthly sessions then you can apply to either enjoy or manometric advertising networks.

<br><br>I mentioned before you can keep away from applying to Google AdSense. It's keeping you safe from any kind of ban or problems with Google AdSense.

<br><br>When you work with that AdSense directly as a new Blogger. You can easily do something accidentally that will get your site blocked and this will close your doors to any other premium ad networks in the future.

<br><br>Because all of them including Ezoic Manometric and Mediavine work with Google as their biggest advertising partner. If your domain has a bad history with the essence it won't be accepted by any premium ad networks ever so again. The 10 bucks a month that you could make with AdSense on a new blog are not worth the risk for your domain.

<br><br>in the future when you get at least 50,000 monthly sessions on your site you can apply for media vine this is a premium ad management company and you will be paid about 10 times more for the same traffic than you could get with AdSense. Keep in mind though that 80% of your audience should come from the United States to be accepted.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Sell your services!</h3>
<p>
  Selling your services when you're just starting a Blog, it's often months of work without a single paycheck while growing your audience. You could reach out to some established bloggers and offer your services as their content writer editor or as a virtual assistant.

  <br><br>You could also offer any other services and promote them through your blog. Like making voiceovers translations graphic design or anything else you're skilled at. I've seen a very successful blog about accounting and guess what? Accountant girl earns a lot more than her colleagues each month because she has established herself as an expert through her blog, the best part about selling your services through the blog is that you don't have to pay commissions that always apply if you use freelance sites to find your clients many beginner bloggers make the majority of their income by selling their services in the first year and I think it's great...

  <br><br>The advanced way of making money from your website it's selling your products you can even sell physical products but I don't know this business for me things like manufacturing branding delivery dealing with return products customs.

  <br><br>All this is a bit too much I prefer myself and I recommend digital products online. If you build your blog or website to help yourself with selling your products. You can have a great income without even spending anything on paid advertising. You can sell lots of different products that don't require a lot of support. For example books, printable files like binders guides, and so on or you can sell stock photos through your site if you're a photographer. Interestingly, a lot of bloggers delay creating products for too long until they almost get burnout from chasing patriots to monetize their site with ads.

  <br><br>I've talked to several one-on-one friends of mine who have established bloggers with large audiences. The only way they monetized was through ads. When I asked why you're not selling products the answer was I kept telling myself I'm not ready yet I'm not good enough yet to sell a product.

</p>
<h4>
  In my opinion and a lot of people are just looking for excuses to stop themselves from making more money with their blogs. If by any chance this is your case you need to work on your mindset.
</h4>
<br><br>
<div class="quote">
  <h4>My Choice</h4>
  <p>
    What I found the best model for me personally is that I like interacting with people and sharing my knowledge. So I found that selling digital products fits my lifestyle best. I prefer selling courses where I can work with my students I can answer the questions help them grow celebrate their wins together and so on. A lot of people think that selling courses requires a ton of bats that you have to constantly stress and that it is a huge risk as you have to work up in front to create the whole course and only when you launch it you will find out if it can sell anything at all.
<br><br>
The best time to start your website was yesterday, The second best time to start is today I hope you enjoyed this guide and found it useful.
