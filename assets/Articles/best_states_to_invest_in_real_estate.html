    <br><br>
    <strong>Price variation and property tax details</strong>
</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Median home price: $722,406</li>
    <li>Average home value increase year over year: 21.0%</li>

<br><br>The state has better conditions in terms of property tax as there is almost no property tax. If any, the rate is small compared to any current investment value.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Florida</h2>

<p>
    According to many reports, Florida is one of the leading states in the country where rental prices and investment works are also increasing. The main reason for this is the increase in the prices of urban land there. This growth is becoming necessary slowly but the trend is continuously upward. Apart from this, the number of small scale factories or offices is also increasing due to increasing business trend in urban areas.
   <br><br><strong>The following are the latest figures which are clearly detailed:</strong>
