  Every new blogger is asking his self what are 7 Highest Paying Blog Niches For Beginners!
  Covering the seven most profitable blog niches for 2022. This isn't some generic video about choosing your passion and then creating a vegan cooking blog that makes you no money. This is about building a true business into the background of your life that elevates your brand and changes your life. So if you stay till the end I'll give you my exact framework to find the most lucrative niche submissions and new product categories that you can rank for and profit from now for years to come.

</p>
<br><br>
<p>
  Choose a bigger niche something you can write more than 10 to 20 articles. Don't choose a niche where you can write only 10 to 20 articles. We want something broad enough that you can eventually write 100 articles maybe 200 articles over some years to be broad enough that you can test different sub-niches within it and see what works based on the data so we wanna start broader with your brand.
<br><br>
So you don't have to like pigeonhole yourself some tiny niche site next there's like profitability so things that are very you know lucrative are gonna also be competitive. If you have a lot of search volume you have a lot of revenue potential. It's gonna be very competitive so think of something like the best credit cards. It's searched a ton it's very lucrative so that's why a brand like NerdWallet is ranking for that making tons of money millions of dollars just for ranking for that. So we have to find things that are trending search volumes but are not too competitive yet we can still find pockets of success ultimately A blog is a mediator so yes we can write about anything, under the sun and try to make ad revenue but make real money we have to talk about affiliate marketing and ranking for these best-paying niches.
<br><br>
<strong>Reviewing products so that's what we're talking.</strong>
<br><br>
And there are three paths to that with affiliate marketing there are three things that we need to do to make a lot of money either high ticket affiliate program.

<br><br>Affiliate programs are programs that can make you money month after month, like subscriptions or software where people sign up and then you make money as long as that customer remains a customer.

<br><br>There's also volume, so when we talk about physical products, I think Amazon like outdoor indoor goods.

<br><br>So let's get started I will introduce you best 7 High Paying Blog Niches For Beginners to get started your blogging career.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  1. Crypto IRAs
</h2>
<p>
  In 2022 number one on my list is IRA's in crypto IRA or retirement accounts. People put money into a retirement account and people do it through affiliate links. if we search Google like the best IRA is the best crypto IRA is the best gold ira is whatever it is many affiliate sites are ranking for those and think about making a 10% Commission on a 500$ retirement account 10% is good $50 for you.

<br><br>It's just that lucrative so it's also somewhat competitive but it's good to know how about this stuff and try to get ahead of it.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  
2. High-end fashion
</h2>
<p>
  Another high ticket option is high-end fashion so we're talking about things like luxury watches luxury handbags and things that cost you know 10,000 plus dollars. Ranking for things like that can also be very lucrative as well so here's an article on the 60 best luxury watch brands to know in 2022. It lays out the different brands click on them and see let's just see what some of the pricing is so here's all these different watches, 16 grand 32 grand 21 grand very expensive so even a 5% Commission on like a $20,000 watch is 1000 bucks maybe yeah $1000 so that's pretty good. Then these things are searched a lot so think about you know what people like search for luxury watches like men like Rolexes and stuff like that, there are also things like Chanel bags Hermes bags that cost $20,000 so there are lots of pockets of opportunity in the high-end fashion space and these are all very high ticket affiliate programs.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  3. Outdoor
</h2>
<p>
  #3 on my list is the outdoor niche so this is not a super high ticket this isn't recurring but it is a volume game you can write about a lot of different stuff and has very low competition.

  <br><br>I can see a lot of different opportunities. We could write about things like the best fishing kayaks fishing rods fishing sunglasses fishing lines. Or if we wanted to go into something like hiking we could do the best hiking stuff and this is a little bit more competitive. In the 30s and 40s but not too bad there are just so many opportunities. Out there I can choose boots for men pants socks backpacks sandals everything like that. What about more expensive products snowmobiles so you could write about all this.

  <br><br>Going broad in your net so choosing the outdoor niche and then testing what you wanna do, you can test the best snowmobiles. You can test things related to hiking and camping and fishing and boating and just see what starts working and become the outdoor person with a good blog and personal brand not some tiny niche about fish boats.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
  4. Tools
</h3>
<p>
  So what if instead of the outdoor Bear Grills survival type stuff or Viking survival hunting, what if it came more to the home? Think about the physicality of where your niche lives we're outside or a little closer to home so this could be things like gardening power tools things that every home depot should have.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
  5.Indoor
</h3>
<p>
  We're gonna move from the outdoor and move inside of the home the indoor niche what do people buy that's expensive. If I think of the kind of higher ticket or you know volume I would think of HomeGoods things like furniture so expensive new furniture categories.

 <br><br> Tons of opportunities for ad revenue for that so much search volume so if you move indoors, it's another volume game but there are so many different products you can write about furniture in the home is a great niche to choose.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
  6. Technology
</h3>
<p>
  When I think about technology might think of laptops and TVs and stuff but what about like camcorders and professional video equipment and audio equipment and stuff like that that isn't as well known?

  <br><br>There are so many new products being created lighting drones and cameras photo accessories professional video stuff. Think about it that way then we start to find opportunities.

  <br><br>Smaller bloggers ranking for this kind of stuff so technology you know writing about different gadgets and things is also really good because there's a lot of new products. Every day new products are being produced you can get ahead of it this. Also great niche, if you're like me, and wanna be a YouTuber potentially in the future. If you wanna get on the video you can show stuff that you can get free. Technology is good because there are a lot of volumes you can write a lot of articles you can find pockets of opportunity and you can make a lot of money doing it so.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
  7. Software
</h3>
<p>
  Last but not least is software and this is the niche that I'm in. Main good thing about it is that it is recurring so you make money. You get people to sign up for your affiliate link and you can make a recurring Commission every month which brings a lot of stability to your business.

<br><br>Pay you recurring like usually 20 to 40 percent 30% pretty standard/ but you get that money every month you don't have to create the software you don't have to do customer support or any of that stuff. You can rank for these keywords and make a percentage every single month as long as the customer remains a customer so it brings a lot of stability to an online business. That's why I like it but it's also you know it's also pretty competitive so you're gonna have to get a lot of links building to compete with this one. It's good because there are a lot of new product categories out there. Bunch of new softwares about team collaboration tools virtual event software there are all kinds of different software you know pockets of opportunity out there.
</p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>
    Ultimately when we think about it what niche do we choose it's gonna be based on your brand and what you want to be known about.

<br><br>I recommend that if you're a beginner the easiest ones to start with are things that are physical products. Things that are lower competition indoor and outdoor goods. I'd love to see bloggers create a type of you know become the next well-known personal brand in the outdoor space or the home design space. Rank for a ton of different things in that are easier to rank for there's a volume you can write a lot of articles. It's not as competitive but if you're experienced you wanna go big! you plan to go on YouTube do what I'm doing. Focus on it put in hundreds of hours of work you can go into something like software or crypto and finance just know that it's very competitive.
