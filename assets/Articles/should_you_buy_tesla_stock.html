<h2>What Is Tesla?</h2>
<p>
    Tesla is an American vehicle and energy company with headquarters in California. Tesla was founded in 2003. The company produces electric vehicles, solar panels, batteries for homes, and a variety of other products that are able to store energy. 
<br><br>When it was introduced in 2012, the Tesla Model S was recognized as the very first luxury all-electric vehicle ever produced. Since Tesla began selling its Model 3 car during the final three months of 2017, the automaker has considerably increased the rate at which it produces the vehicle.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>The Potential Benefits of Owning Tesla Stock</h2>
<p>
    In terms of their impact on the environment, electric vehicles offer a variety of benefits that cannot be matched by gasoline-powered vehicles. Electric vehicles do not produce any noise or contribute to the pollution that is already present in the air. 
    <br><br>It is no longer necessary to have gas stations or individual battery packs due to the widespread availability of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs), which can be refuelled by simply being plugged into an electrical outlet. 
    <br><br>New models are now being developed, and work is currently being done to ensure that these new models will function normally even when being driven on water.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>The Pros of Buying Tesla Stock</h2>
<p>
    Considering that the value of the company's shares has the potential to expand, the company's business is incredibly successful, and the company's future seems promising, investors should give serious consideration to purchasing Tesla stock.
    <br><br>The price of a share of Tesla's stock has more than doubled in the previous year, and on September 18th, it reached a new all-time high of $376 per share. This is a new record high for the price of a share of Tesla's stock. 
    <br><br>The fact that the company is doing well is evidence that there is a significant level of interest in the products it sells. In addition, Tesla's profit margins are relatively high, and the company has a cash flow that is exceptionally strong. 
    <br><br>This demonstrates that it is not required for it to raise money from investors and that it is able to continue investing in the firm's expansion despite not having to do so. Not only does this ensure that Tesla is a safe investment, but it also sets the stage for the company to maintain its level of success in the years to come.
    <br><br>In addition to this, Tesla is rapidly penetrating new markets in an effort to broaden its customer base. It has only recently made an announcement that it plans to develop a factory in China that will have an annual production capacity of 500,000 automobiles.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Tesla’s Success Comes With Risks</h3>
<p>
    A stock market is a place that is both plagued with danger and rich with opportunity. Those who are not well-versed in the inner workings of the stock market may view the stock market as a place that is riddled with uncertainty and difficult to manoeuvre through.
    <br><br>In order to be able to make intelligent decisions when investing in equities, it is vital to have a good grasp of the potential disadvantages connected with purchasing Tesla stock. This is because the purchase of 
    <br><br>Tesla stock may be subject to certain risks.
    <br><br>One of the drawbacks of owning Tesla stock is that the firm has been involved in a variety of various scandals over the past few years, which is one of the company's positives. Tesla has had a lot of trouble keeping its customers happy for a variety of reasons, some of which include, but are not limited to, allegations of fraud and financial mismanagement, production delays, and unexpected price decreases. 
    <br><br>Tesla has also been facing a lot of competition from other electric vehicle manufacturers. As a consequence of this, the value of the company's shares has dropped by a significant amount, making it an extremely risky proposition to invest in them.
    <br><br>Investing in Tesla stock could be dangerous for a variety of reasons, including the fact that there is no guarantee the firm will keep growing at the same rate it is currently growing at.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Why Tesla’s Stock Is So Much Cheaper Today</h2>
<p>
    After the market closed on Wednesday, the firm that makes electric cars carried out a stock split in which each share was divided into three equal parts. 
    <br><br>  Therefore, the price of one share is currently one third of what it was just one day before. 
    <br><br>   Wednesday's trading for Tesla finished at roughly $891, which means that on Thursday it was selling for just a little under $300. In June, Tesla shareholders gave their blessing to the company's second spin-off in the space of two years.
    <br><br>   However, before you start rejoicing about how one Tesla share is now "cheaper," keep in mind that there has been absolutely no change in the valuation of Tesla. After the split, the total value of the corporation is still greater than $930 billion. 
    <br><br> Shares continue to trade at a lofty multiple of more than 70 times 2022 profits expectations, which represents a significant premium in comparison to the valuations of traditional auto companies such as Ford, GM, Volkswagen, and Toyota. 
    <br><br> As a result of investor anxiety on increased competition in the EV market from traditional automakers as well as Musk's many prospective distractions, the stock has continued to decline and is currently trading approximately 15% lower than it was at the beginning of the year. 
    <br><br>  The only thing that was altered as a result of the stock split was the fact that current shareholders now control three times as many shares of Tesla, which are now trading at a price that is one third lower than where they finished on Wednesday.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3></h3>
<p>
    Due to the fact that Tesla still possesses a significant amount of its unrealized potential, investors should give serious consideration to purchasing some of the company's stock. 
    <br><br>At this point in time, the only automobile manufacturer that can credibly declare that it is a disruptive force in the automotive industry is Tesla. 
    <br><br>Tesla is the only company that produces electric vehicles. It has developed a new technology that has the potential to lead to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, which are generally regarded as the mode of transportation that will prevail in the foreseeable future.
    <br><br> This technology has the potential to lead to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. 
    <br><br>Additionally, the market valuation of Tesla is not very high, which gives it an investment option that is accessible to investors with modest budgets. This is because Tesla is an electric car manufacturer.
