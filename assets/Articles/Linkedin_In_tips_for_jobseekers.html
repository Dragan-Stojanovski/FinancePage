        Whether you want to develop a business LinkedIn profile or a personal network, LinkedIn is a great platform to use to achieve your business goals. When used in the right way, it can help you raise your brand awareness and increase your business traffic.
        <br><br>Unfortunately, most people use LinkedIn wrong.
        <br><br>That is why we will deal with this topic in the text that follows
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>LinkedIn - tips for success on this social network</h2>
        <p>
        You are probably already familiar with the operation of this social network and use it, and if you are not - this is a good opportunity to learn more about it.
        <br><br>LinkedIn is a social network designed to connect employers and job seekers. In addition, it will help you in increasing the number of business contacts.
        <br><br>Due to increasing computer literacy, LinkedIn has become a very popular social network in recent years. Today, it has over 645 million users from 200 countries around the world, and it is estimated that it gets more than two new users every second.
        <br><br>We hope that you now understand why this social network is so important in business. That is why we will now move on to <strong>LinkedIn profile tips for job seekers</strong> that will be important to you in presenting yourself on LinkedIn:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Update your LinkedIn profile</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        It's easy to forget to update your profile information whenever you learn a new skill or get a promotion at work. However, outdated information does not give a good impression that people get about you when they visit your profile. People may assume that you are inactive or that you are not worth connecting with them.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Use polished and professional photos</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        LinkedIn is a platform for business professionals and their promotion, so it is important that the profile display is professional.
        <br><br> The most important photos on your profile are your face photo and your cover photo. Your headshot is the photo people will see every time your profile appears in the news or when you get in touch with someone, so it's important to make sure it's high quality and professional looking.
        <br><br> Of course, that doesn't mean you have to be in a formal suit and buttoned up to the neck. According to LinkedIn, if you have a profile photo, visits to your profile increase up to 21 times and you will receive 9 times more connection requests.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Creating compelling content</h3>
        <br>
        <p>It's important that the content on your profile accomplishes three things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To send a clear message about your brand's story and value</li>
          <li>Display in relevant search results using keywords</li>
          <li>Providing value to people who find it</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        The most important content on your LinkedIn profile is the title and summary. The title works by helping you provide context and a hook for visitors to latch onto and stick with.
        <br><br>The summary should clearly state what you do and how you can help your target market.
        <br><br>When creating a compelling profile summary, follow certain rules that will help you. Use simple and clean language, without jargon and acronyms, so that the content is understandable and easy to read. Emphasize the specific results you provide to your users and stick to the facts – don't use superlatives and exaggeration.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Proofread everything you post</h3>
        <br>
        <p>We'll come back to the fact that LinkedIn is a platform for professionals. Your profile should ensure your credibility and survival in the LinkedIn community - which means that it is important that the content is grammatically correct.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Emphasize your skills</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        Be sure to highlight the languages ​​you speak, volunteer work, honors and awards, patents and all the skills you possess on your LinkedIn profile. The more elements you add to your LinkedIn profile, the more likely you are to connect with different people. Make sure you rank your skills so that the top three are the most visible.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Convert your LinkedIn visitors into followers</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        People who don't know you who come across your LinkedIn profile are more likely to follow you than connect with you. That's why it's important to change the CTA button on your profile to "Follow" instead of "Connect".
        
        <br><br>This small change can result in faster growth of your network and more engagement.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Optimize your posts</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        You can create three types of content directly on this social network: photo posts, videos and articles. Although other social networks are dominated by visuals, text content is more important on LinkedIn. You have the option of adding up to 1300 characters in each post, but the first 2-3 lines are the most important because they are all the audience can see until they click the "…see more" option.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Include articles in LinkedIn content as well</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        Because people have to click on LinkedIn Publisher's longer-form texts for it to count as an engagement, don't expect the same numbers as with videos. Although the numbers will be lower, it can be a sign of your audience's interest.
        <br><br>Publisher posts must be promoted through posts like the promotion of external content. Additionally, Publisher posts appear as larger thumbnails on your LinkedIn profile page.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Be consistent</h3>
        <br>
        <p>LinkedIn's algorithm promotes people who post regularly. It is recommended that you post 1-2 posts per day. LinkedIn most often promotes those who post 3-4 content per day. However, do not get carried away and put quantity before quality. If you publish often, it is very important that your content is of high quality.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Use #hashtags</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        LinkedIn also supports the use of hashtags and it is very important that you use them. When using hashtags on this social network, make sure they are related to your content, company and business. Try not to use more than 5-6 hashtags per post, including longer texts.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Invest in promotion</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Investing in LinkedIn promotion is one of the surest ways to increase engagement on your LinkedIn profile. You can sponsor content for greater visibility or pay for personalized ads that will be sent directly to other users' inboxes.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Each of these tips can help you in different ways to build a more visited profile that will help you achieve your business goals. As you implement some of these tips into managing your LinkedIn profile, be sure to track the results to see for yourself what works best. And of course, don't forget that investing time and effort is very important!</p>
