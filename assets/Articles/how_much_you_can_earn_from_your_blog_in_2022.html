  I think one of the hardest things for bloggers is the fear uncertainty and doubt that comes in this line of business. Really like any business, there's no guarantee of success or even an idea of how long it's gonna take to succeed.


<br><br>Timeline of the work that you need to do as a Blogger. Just how long it's gonna take to start getting results these numbers are based on averages. We have built dozens of blogs ourselves and worked with thousands of bloggers. We've done some studies through polls and have a really good idea of how long it's on average as long as they're putting in the work.

<br><br>In the first six months, gotta get as much content on your site as early as possible. The reason is for a new website it usually takes about eight months on average for content to reach the level of traffic where it's gonna start to level off.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  First six months(0-6 months)
</h2>
<p>
  In the first two months, I typically wanna see you right about 30 articles on your site. And by the end of six months, 60 pieces of content on your website is a reasonable goal to shoot for. <br><br>What's gonna help you achieve this result is what I'm gonna talk about throughout the rest of this timeline. What you can expect at the six-month mark in terms of traffic and terms of income?
<br><br>
At this point, you might see a number like 150 page views a month. Some of that's gonna be bought traffic I mean it's just very very little. It's starting to trickle in at this point, and earnings if you've had a $5 month at this point that's great. That's exactly where you should be at this point and if you haven't quite hit $5 that's OK as well. It's probably coming very very soon again as long as you're keeping up with the timeline. That means doing pretty good search analysis meaning you're identifying good topics to write about.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  Over the second six months(6-12 months)
</h2>
<p>
  You should have 100 to 120 articles for the next six-month mark if you wanna start getting help and outsource some of that content that's OK.<br><br>

I don't want you doing it before that point though make that promise to yourself. That you're gonna learn how to write good content first.<br><br>Then once you appreciate the work it takes to do it and know what good content takes and what it looks like then outsourcing starts to become OK. At the 12-month mark if you've done exactly what I just told you to do.<br><br>

If you have done what I just told you to do you may still only see 5.000 to 10,000 pages per month on your blog. The reason for this is again only the very first content on your website, has hit the level where it would achieve the hockey stick-shaped growth. Where it goes from a very very slow trickle in traffic to hoop suddenly.<br><br>
<strong>
You're not gonna have huge traffic at this point. Because of that 110 to $220 in earnings at this point is reasonable to expect.
</strong>
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  Over this third six months(12-18 months)
</h2>
<p>
  The next six months are where things start to get fun and interesting. Every time new content hits about a year old. We like to take that batch of content those first thirty articles you wrote in the first two months.<br><br>

What you're gonna be doing next is analyzing content and see how well it performed. You're gonna see which articles did well that's gonna help. You know what to write next it's gonna help you know the formatting of your future blog post.<br><br>

New content that you're writing in the next six months. It's just gonna be even better because now you know what's working. It's also gonna help you know which articles you can revamp and improve so at this point our pay for new content is slowing down once you get that mark you may never write another new article again. Placing an article that you just decided this one failed I'm gonna write a new article and just keep a solid 100 good articles on my website. At this time you may say I still need to add new content depending on your niche. If your niche requires that to stay fresh and so you're gonna write at least a blog post every week or so right.<br><br>

Once you hit that 18 months mark you want to see more than 30.000 to 50,000 page views per month on your website. That's because at this point you have at 18 months you have at least 60 articles right that are over a year old. 60 articles each one of them averages about 500 page views a month that's 30,000 pages.<br><br> I want to know all the content you wrote after that may not be at the highest level of traffic. That's gonna get to but it's getting there 50,000 pageviews a month is a reasonable expectation again especially if you did a good job and follow the things that we're teaching here.
<br><br>
<strong>With that level of traffic you can expect earnings of 1800 to $2000 a month, this is normal.</strong>
<br><br>

Here's what happens as your site grows and as you've had ads on your site for longer more and more optimized to your Audience and with time becoming more and more valuable to advertisers.
<br><br>

They're gonna be willing to pay more to get their ads on your website. You're going to see your RPM your revenue per thousand page views is gonna start to go up a little bit on your ads. You're also gonna find that you're more you're eligible for more affiliate programs.
</p>
<h3>
  Optimize your blog posts
</h3>
<p>
  At this stage I want you to start looking at other optimizations the one I really wanna highlight here is interlinking. I'm gonna have to tell a whole other video on this at some point but interlinking can be very very valuable, it's where you take an article on your website can you just link to another article on your website. Oftentimes in any given blog post especially once you have 100 or 200 blog posts on your site. There's gonna be a few other articles on your site that would make sense for this reader to want to go read. Interlinking between them can be very very valuable.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  Fourth six months(18-24 months)
</h2>
<p>
  24 months is very very normal to see .... 100,000 page views per month or more.<br><br>

And with 100,000 pageviews a month turning $4000 per month is real!<br><br>

Once you hit about that six-month mark. if you have the funds to be able to do that and you can find writers. Whether it's through a service or whether you find writers that are specific to your niche. Because it's something maybe a little bit more industry knowledge to write about either way you're gonna be able to scale up the amount of content you can add to your site.<br><br> Instead of 200 articles in two years you end up with maybe more like 400 articles in two years and by doing that you speed this whole thing up and instead of $4000 a month you're already more like <strong>$8000 a month.</strong>
