    A person is never too young to start investing money. It is even possible for a teenager to go ahead and invest money. In fact, investing as a teenager can deliver amazing returns in the long run. Teenagers who wish to invest have a lot of time on their hands. 
<br><br>However, they don’t have a lot of capital or experience. 
<br><br>Therefore, a teenager will not be able to proceed with any type of an investment. That’s why we thought of writing this article to share details on the best long-term investments that teenagers can try as of now.
<br><br>What are the best investments that a teenager can start? Here’s a list of some of the most convenient investment opportunities available for a teenager to consider as of now. If you are trying to get your teenager involved in investing, you can pick one of these and provide assistance accordingly.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
    Micro saving mobile apps
</h3>
<br>
<p>
    Teenagers are well-versed with technology. As a result, it is possible for them to get their hands on investments that are linked with technology without any major issues. This is where the micro-saving mobile apps would come into play. 
    <br><br>   You will be able to get a teenager to learn more about financial responsibility with the assistance of a micro-saving app. There are multiple apps available out there for the teenagers to consider. You just need to make sure that you pick the right option out of them for your teenager. 
    <br><br>  The concept behind micro-saving apps is quite easy to understand. When you are purchasing something through the app, it would round-up the amount. For example, if your teenager goes ahead and purchases a cup of coffee for $5.5, the micro saving mobile app would round up the total cost to $5. Then the remaining $0.50 will be invested in the stock market. This is quite a hassle-free investment opportunity available for a teenager to try in day to day life.
    <br><br>  If you are searching for a micro saving mobile app, you may take a look at Webull. It is an app that doesn’t come with a minimum deposit. On the other hand, the app has a very low monthly fee as well. Learn more about the app and get your teen to start using it.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Stock market investing </h3>
<br>
<p>Instead of investing through a micro saving mobile app, your child will be able to get directly into stock investments as well. The level of risk associated with investing money in individual stocks is relatively high when compared to the risk linked with holding index funds. However, the teenagers would surely love the overall idea of investing their money in favorite companies. It will provide them with a rewarding experience of owning a share of the company. 
    <br><br>  Without directly asking your teenager to invest in stocks, you need to get him/her ready for the task as well. This is where you can tell your teenage child on how to proceed with investing in a company. This should involve more on researching on how to invest in stocks as well. That’s because somewhat decent background knowledge is required to get the maximum returns out of investing in stocks. 
    <br><br>  The process of investing can help your teenager to get a better understanding of the things that are happening in the economy around him/her. By owning a share of a particular company, your child will be more on more alert about the things that are happening around. It would surely assist your teenager to remain abreast of the issues that could take place.
    <br><br>  However, one of the problems that is associated with investing money in favorite companies is that some of them would have highly priced stocks. This is where you can guide your teenager on how to save money, so that they can proceed with investing money to buy stocks in the favorite company. Alongside, you can share the benefits that a teenager can have by saving some money in a savings account as well. </p>
<br><br>
<h2>Real estate investments</h2>
<br>
<p>
    Teenagers don’t have a lot of money to get into real estate investing. However, it doesn’t mean that someone should stay away from investing in real estate. There are multiple alternative options available for a teenager to go ahead and invest in real estate.
    <br><br>   Out of options available for a teenager to invest in real estate, NFT real estate holds a prominent place. NFT real estate is pretty much similar to other types of NFTs. It is possible to use cryptocurrencies and purchase the NFTs. Then the buyer can hold NFT real estate inside a digital wallet and sell it at a later stage while keeping a profit. 
    <br><br>  NFTs are quite risky and new. However, with proper knowledge and right strategies, it is possible to get NFTs to deliver amazing results. By getting hands on NFT real estate at a young age, it is possible to take a bigger risk. The risks that a teenager would take at the time of investing in NFT real estate would not create a negative impact on real estate investment portfolio as well.
    <br><br>  Another option available for the teenagers is to flip houses. You will need to provide assistance to your child in finding the capital needed to flip houses. House flipping is all about purchasing a fixer-upper home and improving it to sell at a later stage for profit. It is possible to find foreclosure houses and flip them to earn a great income. The entry barrier that you have to overcome when flipping houses is relatively low. Therefore, anyone can get into this kind of an investment without having to worry too much about anything. 
    <br><br>  Teenagers who are looking for long-term investments may also take a look at real estate investment trusts. REITs are the companies that operate, own, and manage the income generated out of real estate assets. Most REITs that you can find out there are available on stock exchanges. It is possible for a teenager to go ahead and buy them online by spending very little capital. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
    Checking and savings accounts
</h3>
<br>
<p>
    There are few online banks, which have earned reputation for delivering higher interest rates to people. You may think about encouraging your teenager to invest in checking and savings accounts in those banks. This is a great example for a long-term investment, which is associated with very little risk. 
    <br><br>It is important for you to do a bit of a background study and then figure out checking and savings accounts offered by reputed online banks. Then you can encourage your teenager to proceed with investing money in them. These investments are much better when compared to the traditional investments done in brick and mortar banks.
    <br><br>If your teenager is making a decent income with a part-time job, you may recommend this long-term investment without a major concern. However, it is also important to teach that the main objective of investing in checking and savings accounts is not to earn an interest. It will also help your teenager to develop basic financial skills. These financial skills would surely benefit your teenager for the rest of his/her life. 
    <br><br>You will need to get involved in the account creation process as well. That’s because most banks out there request a parent or even a guardian to go ahead and co-sign on the checking or savings account.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Investing money in a business </h3>
<br>
<p>
    There are various businesses that teenagers can start. You can encourage your teenager to invest money in starting a business as well. This is where you can take a look at the low-capital investment opportunities, where a teenager would be able to start without comprehensive business knowledge. 
    <br><br>  You should also keep in mind that the idea of investing money directly into a business can be quite dangerous. Failures in businesses can teach some valuable lessons to your teenager. However, those failures usually come at a cost as well. For example, if the business is owned by a parent or another person who is closer to the parent, you may think about encouraging your child to invest in them. 
    <br><br>  Not every teenager would like to keep a business going in the long term. Therefore, you should check and see whether your teenager is interested in the idea of having a long-term business or not. If the teenager is not willing to continue the business in the long run, it is not a good idea to invest a lot on it. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Starting a Roth IRA</h3>
<br>
<p>Another great long-term investment opportunity available for a teenager would be starting a Roth IRA account. These individual retirement accounts can deliver amazing returns to any teenager in the long run. On the other hand, a Roth IRA would make your child pay taxes to the contributed amount of money right away, when the income gets lower. When it comes to a traditional IRA, your child will have to pay at the time of withdrawing money. Because a teenager will be able to continue with making more money, it is quite beneficial to pay all the taxes within a lower tax bracket. 
    <br><br>  When compared to custodial accounts, you will notice some differences in the Roth IRA accounts. That’s because it will not be possible to have a Roth IRA account till the time they end up with getting a job that helps them with making money. However, teenagers who are working for part-time jobs will not have to worry too much about it. </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Investing in index funds</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        Teenagers usually love to receive instant gratification. Because of that, the process of learning how to invest money long-term might not feel so appealing to them. This is why you should look for a long-term investment strategy that will help your teenage child to remain engaged. Then it is possible for the child to have better control over all the investments. 
        <br><br>  It is true that the most appealing investment that teenagers would like to get their hands on would be tech stocks. However, you can convince your child to invest in index funds, as they are in a position to deliver some significant benefits. Since the process of investing in index funds can be engaging, you can make sure that your kid will not get bored as well. 
        <br><br>  By investing in index funds, your kid will be able to get exposure to his/her favorite companies out there as well. However, the good thing is that your kid will not just be limited to one investment. It provides a great overall investing experience for the kid.
    </p>
<br><br>
<h3>Certificates of Deposits </h3>
<br>
<p>
    Certificates of Deposits, which are also known as CDs are a great risk-free example for a long-term investment. This may not look so attractive for your teenager as investing money in the stock market. However, you can explain more about the lower risk associated with it. 
    <br><br>  One of the best reasons to invest money in CDs is that they come along with FDIC insurance. As a result, it would be possible to reduce the stress that some teens will have to deal with at the time of investing their money. 
    <br><br>  You should also keep in mind that there are many different terms that people use to call CDs. No matter what, the concept behind all of them is pretty much the same. Along with the help of CDs, it will be possible for you to get better returns out of the money you invest. Since CDs deliver the best returns by holding it for so long, you may ask your teenager to proceed with this long-term investment without keeping a doubt in mind.
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h4>Final words</h4>
<br>
<p>As you can see, multiple long-term investment opportunities are available for teenagers to consider as of now. As a parent or an adult, it is important to provide basic guidance on how to go ahead with such investments. Then it is possible to help your child get the most returns out of these investments. </p>
