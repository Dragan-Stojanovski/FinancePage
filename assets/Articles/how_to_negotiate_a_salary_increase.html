    <p>You have been part of the company's team for some time, you are hardworking, you have good results and you think it is time for a salary increase. On the other hand, you are wondering what is the best and most effective way to ask for a raise.
    </p>
    <p>
        The truth is, there's nothing wrong with asking for a raise.
    <br><br>Before you go to your boss, you should know that certain approaches and practices when negotiating a higher salary will always work better than others.
    <br><br>You need to know when and how to ask for a raise, what are the right questions to ask, how to negotiate with your boss, and how to carve out a win and get the raise you want.
    <br><br>Never ask for a raise without properly preparing for the upcoming interview. Prepare in advance several reasons why you think you deserve a raise. Always try to work objectively
    <br><br>Even if you are aware that you deserve a higher salary, you, like many other people, may hesitate whether or not to ask for it.
    <br><br>There are three options available to you. You can do nothing, but you can stay indefinitely with your current salary. You can ask for a job position that offers better pay, or you can simply ask for a raise. Sitting back and waiting for your boss to make the first move won't pay off, and looking for a new job can bring additional problems no one needs.
    <br><br>Use some of the following tips on how to most effectively ask for a raise and succeed
    
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h2>1. Define your goal before the interview with the manager and prepare</h2>
    <br><p>
        Be clear about your expectations when you talk to your boss. What do you want to achieve? What message do you want to send? What would be the realistic outcome of the expectations? Is there a deadline by which you would like to achieve your goal? What would be your answer/reaction if the answer is "no" and are you ready for it? Do you already have a specific raise amount in mind? Have you discussed this topic with the employer before and what did you learn from it?
    <br><br>Can you discuss it with colleagues who previously had the same expectations or are preparing for the same conversation with superiors? Dissatisfaction with the salary you receive is not a clear enough strategy to present to your boss.
    
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h2>2. Don't forget self-confidence!</h2>
    <br>  <p>
        If you yourself are not convinced that you deserve more money, it will be difficult for you to convince your boss of the same. So be "armed" with facts - What are your qualities, responsibilities, achievements and ask for a salary increase based on them.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h3>3. Focus on the merits, not the reasons</h3>
    <br><p>
        The company is not interested in you having credit and big expenses that require more money. Don't beg for a raise in that case. Instead, explain precisely and clearly why you deserve a higher salary, highlighting the employee's strengths.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h3>
        4. Choose the right time
    </h3>
    <br> <p>
        Choosing the right time to ask for a raise also plays a big role. This way you will ensure that you are not asking for the impossible. Research has shown that the best time is after the successful completion of an important project or presentation of a well-done commitment.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h3>
        5. Find out how much you could be earning
    </h3>
    <br>  <p>
        Remember that due to factors such as education and experience, your salary may differ from the average in your industry or from the salaries of acquaintances in the same sector. Be realistic when thinking about your expectations. Consider the number of years in the industry, your education and credibility, and your length of time with your current employer. Taking location into account, jobs in larger cities tend to pay more than jobs in smaller towns.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h3>
        6. Be aware that this is a difficult topic for your superior as well
    
    </h3>
    <br>  <p>
        Do everything you can so that the imposition of this topic is not perceived as a threat, an obstacle in the work, or to put your superior in an uncomfortable situation, and at least he should experience it as blackmail. Try to understand that the manager for approving a salary increase has limitations and requires the approval of his superiors if it is a larger company, and if it is a smaller company, the employer is not always able to increase your salary, although he would like to. did so.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h2>7. What if you get a no?</h2>
    <br> <p>
        Before walking into your supervisor's office, think about the possible scenario of hearing "no" or getting a raise that's far less than you asked for. Will you quit or wait and try again after a week? Your answer may depend on your boss's answer.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h3>Be ready to answer "no"</h3>
    <br>  <p>
        The following scenario is also possible - your boss rejects you. What to do next depends solely on the answer he/she gives you. If he says he's denying your request because of your performance, it's up to you to decide if he's right. If so, think about what you could change about yourself for better results. If the answer is no and you think these are just excuses, maybe you should work in a place where your work will be appreciated.
    <br><br>    However, find out if there is room to work. Don't rush the decision, maybe the joint decision of your boss to help you in your work can result in better results for the company and that will lead to an increase in your salary, your original goal.

            If you were canceled - it doesn't stop there
            </h3>
            <p>
                Don't be ashamed of the fact that you asked for more money. Don't be ashamed of the fact that you were canceled. Instead, consider these possibilities:
                <br><br>If your boss doesn't seem convinced by the refusal, ask him what you can do to get a raise.
                <br><br>If your boss responds that the company is in a bad spot right now, ask for the request to be reviewed again when possible.
                <br><br>If you are denied a raise, try to negotiate any bonuses.
                <br><br>If you bear additional responsibilities and tasks, but they don't want to give you more money for it, it's time to look for a new job.
