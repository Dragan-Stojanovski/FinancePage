<h2>What are freelance jobs and how to become a freelancer?
</h2>
<p>
    Freelance jobs are a very widespread way of earning, and the fact that you can be a freelancer from your<strong> own armchair </strong>makes this job even more attractive.
<br><br>Earning online requires a certain set of skills that are not difficult to acquire today, which is why many people choose this way of earning.
<br><br>If you have a good computer, solid knowledge of the English language, and a desire to avoid classic office working hours from 9 to 5, then it's time to find out how freelance jobs work and what separates you from becoming a successful freelancer.
<br><br><strong>How do freelance jobs work?</strong>
<br>
Freelance jobs function as permanent or additional jobs. How you will deal with freelancing depends only on you. To begin with, a few of the most important characteristics of freelancers should be taken into account.
<br><br>Freelance business takes place on platforms of the same name, which are intended to connect employers and freelancers from different fields. Depending on your skills, the recommendations you have, the time you are ready to devote to work, and the professionalism you show through cooperation with employers, your freelance business grows or stagnates.

</p>
<br><br>
<img src="../img/free_lance_lady_dring_coffe.png" width="100%">
<h2>
    Freelance as an additional job
</h2>
<p>
    Freelance jobs are the most attractive to those who want additional income in this way. This variant is suitable for all those who want a certain amount of work to be done several times a week, but not to opt for freelance as their main job, nor to accept a larger number of projects than previously defined, regardless of the existing interest of employers.
    <br><br>In this case, it is enough to reflect the profile on freelance platforms to the extent that it looks decent and gives basic information and recommendations about you, which qualify you as a reliable freelancer, but when freelancing is just an additional source of income, there is usually no motive to significantly improves the profile, because it would also mean a greater number of projects for which, in this case, you are not in the mood.

</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
    Freelance as a permanent job
</h2>
<br>
<p>
    Freelance as a permanent job requires a lot of time, effort and skills invested in what you do. If you want freelance jobs to be your main source of income, it is necessary to build your credibility on freelance platforms, and to collect a sufficient number of relevant recommendations that evaluate your work in the best way.
    <br><br>Of course, this takes time, so you should also know that freelance earnings start from zero and slowly rise to higher figures, while only the most persistent reach the amount sufficient for all life needs, although earnings can become extremely high after a few years. and attractive, which still requires serious engagement in the freelance world.

</p>
<br><br>
<h2>How to become a freelancer?
</h2>

<br>
<p>
    To become a competitive freelancer, it is not enough to open a profile on one of the popular freelance platforms. There are too many of them, and only those who really know how to do their job stand out from the crowd, and who in this way collect great recommendations from employers. Here are the most important prerequisites for becoming a freelancer, once you enter one of the freelance platforms:
</p>
<img src="../img/freelance_learn_skills.png" width="100%">
<br>
<h3>1. You have some of the required skills and speak English</h3>
<br>
<p>
    The most sought-after skills on freelance platforms are those possessed by programmers, developers, graphic and web designers, SEO experts, copywriters, social network experts, translators and bloggers.
    <br><br>If you want to be serious about freelancing, it is necessary that you really have an almost professional command of some of these jobs, and that you know how to cope with more demanding projects in the sphere of your profession.
    <br><br>A prerequisite for a freelance "career" is a good (if not excellent) knowledge of the English language, both for communication with employers and for the projects that you will most often work on in this language.

</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
    2. You don't give up easily
</h3>
<br>
<p>
    Any successful freelancer can testify that freelance jobs do not bring money overnight, so patience is of key importance for any progress in this business.
    <br><br>It takes several months to establish yourself on these platforms, and sometimes even more to be recognized as a valuable, reliable and quality freelancer.
    <br><br>However, if you are lucky, you can get great projects even after a few weeks, and it all depends on how you present yourself and who can recommend you on these platforms.

</p>
<br><br>
<h4>
    Bonus Tip: You perform your tasks professionally
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        The recommendations mentioned several times do not come by themselves, but you have to earn them through serious engagement and professional performance of tasks. This implies respect for deadlines and all other agreements, as well as quality work.
        <br><br>This is not only the way to a valuable recommendation, but also to permanent jobs, since once a satisfied employer will be happy to hire you permanently for projects where you have performed well.

    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>
        3. You regularly update your profile and check and search for new jobs every day
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        The profile on the freelance platform is what "sells" you to employers, so if you want to be noticed in the sea of ​​freelancers, and then to keep the credibility you once gained, it is necessary to regularly update your profile, get new recommendations and work on the overall appearance of your "freelance CV".
    </p>
    <br><br>
<h3>
    How much does a freelancer earn?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
    It is difficult to determine the average salary of a freelancer, considering that the amount of salary depends on your engagement and dedication to this work. If you join freelance platforms to work occasionally, you should not expect big numbers, because even though earning money online sometimes sounds beautiful and fairy-tale, it actually requires enormous dedication and self-discipline in terms of time management.
    <br><br>All freelancers start from scratch, working for smaller employers, and smaller projects, at slightly lower hourly rates than those set by experienced freelancers.
    <br><br>Almost no one can initially set a price of 50 dollars per hour if they do not have previous experience and recommendations from clients, which is why it is important to reach such figures by progressing in the business, step by step.

</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
    When is a freelance (un)profitable?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
    An equally good question is: why freelance jobs at all? The biggest motive for engaging in freelance work is to reach the level of earnings that employers in your country cannot provide.
<br><br>Therefore, freelancing as a permanent job and the main source of income is acceptable only if it offers you more than what you can earn on the domestic market. Otherwise, you are not in a big plus, unless you have designated freelance as a source of your additional income.
<br><br>Also, you should know that freelance is the best choice for those who have the knowledge and some experience in the business they plan to do on these platforms. Why? Precisely because as a beginner or amateur on these platforms you can get fewer jobs, learn little or even nothing, and stagnate for months (or years) at the same level.
<br><br>On the other hand, if you are a beginner - in programming, for example - a regular job can bring you knowledge and experience that you will later apply (and pay very well) freelancing.

</p>
<br><br>
<h3>
    Advantages of freelance jobs
</h3>
<br>
<p>
    The biggest advantage of freelance jobs is that they bring more income than what you would earn sitting in an office, provided you are professional enough and dedicated to this type of work.
    <br>In addition, freelance is a type of work that you organize yourself from your own home, so you have no superiors, you can take a break whenever you want, and at the same time, you are given the opportunity to work on the most diverse projects that you would probably never experience in a regular job.
    <br>In addition, freelancing offers the possibility of improving your language and skills on a daily basis if you are really committed to it. And finally, probably the most important feature of freelancing - you choose the pace, volume, and type of work you will do.
