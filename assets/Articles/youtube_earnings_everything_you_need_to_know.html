        Let's get one thing, straight people. If you had asked me two or three years ago what I thought about making money on YouTube, I would have said let it go. There is no bread. You better go to school, son.
        <br><br>Let PewDiePie and other people make money because the only way to get a dime from YouTube is to be provocative, scandalous, and make a reality show yourself.
        <br><br>Or is it not? <strong>Maybe there is a way to make money</strong> nicely and honestly, giving people useful and educational content, what do you think?
         <br><br>Likewise, I would like to encourage all those who want to deal with YouTube through this text and motivate them through my example. I would also like to clarify some doubts that may exist about YouTube through this text. How to make money on YouTube?<strong> Exactly how much money can you expect?</strong> <strong>Can you make a living from YouTube?</strong>
        <br><br>Well Lets Get Started.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>How do I start making money from YouTube and turn on monetization?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        To enable monetization at all, that is, earning from YouTube, you need to have at least <strong>1,000 followers and a minimum of 4,000 hours of views</strong> on your channel. Basically, this is not too difficult and if you just dedicate yourself to shooting a little, you will quickly reach this figure.
        <br><br>If you are just starting out, in your YouTube studio when you go to the monetization field, you can see exactly how far you are from meeting these criteria.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>     How do you make money on youtube?    </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        <strong>YouTubers primarily make money from ads that play while watching their videos.</strong> These ads can be played at the beginning of the video as skippable ads (ads that can be skipped), bumper ads (ads that must be viewed and the video starts after them), or ads at the end of the video, as well as ads that the author can place on specific places in the flow of his video
        <br><br>So, for videos of eight minutes and less, you can only earn from playing ads at the beginning and end of the video, while for videos longer than eight minutes, you can place as many ads as you want in that video yourself. 
        <br><br>Let's say, for a video that is about 20 minutes long, it is perfectly fine to place three or four additional ads, and if the user watches the video to the end, the earnings from the video will be much higher.
        <br><br>You should not exaggerate so that the user does not get annoyed and leave your video. You will not put an ad every two minutes, because this will only create a counter-effect in the viewer and they will exit the video earlier than they planned.
        <br><br>
        In addition to this, if you have a strong YouTube channel with a lot of followers, one of the ways of monetization can be advertising of other companies on your channel. You determine the cost price of marketing their products or services in your video. You negotiate the price yourself and this may be the best way to earn in the long run because you decide how much you will earn and what price you will achieve.
        <br><br>
        <strong>After this information, you are probably asking yourself the following question.</strong>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>  
        How Much Earnings Can I Expect From YouTube?   </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        To understand how YouTube earnings work, you first need to understand two terms, CPM and RPM.
        
        CPM (Cost per mile) – the price advertisers pay for 1000 video ad impressions. If an advertiser says they will pay $2 for 1000 impressions during campaign creation, the CPM is $2. The average CPM with us is from 1 to 6 US dollars.
        <br><br>RPM (Revenue per mile) – the revenue your video generates per thousand video views. RPM is based on multiple revenue streams, including ads, channel memberships, YouTube Premium revenue, Super Chat, and Super Stickers. RPM is always lower than CPM, and in most cases, it is from 0.5 to 2 dollars.
        <br><br>So, if the RPM is $1, that means that for every 1,000 views, you'll earn exactly that much.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>What affects CPM and RPM?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        
        <strong>Geographical location</strong> - the thing that perhaps has the most influence on how much you can earn per 1000 views. If your video is viewed by people from developed countries such as the countries of Western Europe, America, Canada and the Emirates, expect up to several dollars more for every 1000 views, than if your visitors come from the Philippines, Pakistan and the like.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Switzerland-$4.70</li>
        <li>Sweden-$4.54</li>
        <li>Denmark-$3.89</li>
        <li>Germany-$3.87</li>
        <li>United Kingdom-$3.51</li>
        <li>Netherlands-$3.39</li>
        <li>Austria-$2.73</li>
        <li>France-$2.73</li>
        <li>Italy-$2.30</li>
        <li>Slovenia-$1.56</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>So, if you create content that could be viewed by people from richer countries, you have a great chance to earn more on this platform.  </h4>
        <p>
        <strong>Video View Length </strong>– The higher percentage of views your video has, the more revenue it will generate, as more ads can be played while it is being watched. In addition, a video that people will watch for a long time will also serve as an excellent signal to YouTube that it is of high quality, and they will recommend it more as Suggested videos later, thus earning you even more money. Therefore, the focus should be on creating a video that visitors will want to watch as long as possible.
        <br><br>Think about how you can do something to keep viewers on your video for as long as possible.
        <br><br><strong>Adhering to YouTube's rules</strong> - If your videos follow all the guidelines that YouTube requires, ads will appear more often in your videos and bring you more money as well. Take care of these things. – LINK TO YOUTUBE GUIDELINES.
        <br><br><strong>Advertiser Friendly Thumbnail</strong> - also make sure that your thumbnail (the cover image of the video) respects all the guidelines, because if you break a rule, your video will be seen by fewer people. You can also read about it in YouTube's rules.
        <br><br><strong>The number of people with ad blockers turned on</strong> - the more of your viewers turn on the ban on ads, the less money you will make, but this cannot be influenced.
        <br><br><strong>The topic of your videos </strong>- even the topic of your videos itself, will affect how much you earn per 1000 views. Videos with "more expensive keywords" will logically earn more money.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3> Provide educational and interesting content that at the end of the day, really provides some value.</h3>
        <br>
        <p> This is exactly what you need to keep in mind when you decide to start with YouTube. Ask yourself, what is it that you know that can enable someone to have a better life? Here are some ideas if it's not very clear.  </p> 
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Fitness Channel</strong> - Do you know of a special type of crunch that almost no one does that is proven to reduce body fat?</li>
        <li><strong>Channel about cars</strong> - How can you really check how many kilometers a car has traveled?</li>
        <li> <strong>Pet Channel </strong>- How Often Do Dogs Eat  </li>
        <li><strong> The Healthy Food Channel </strong>- Five quick and easy vegan recipes you can make at home. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these topics aims to offer some value and some new knowledge to the target audience watching your YouTube channel. </p>
        <br>
