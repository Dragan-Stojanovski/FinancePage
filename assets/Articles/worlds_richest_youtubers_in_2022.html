    <p>Most stars from the past decade have come from YouTube but just how much do the biggest YouTubers make today?</p>
    <p>
        I put together a list of some of the highest-earning YouTubers around right now. Keep in mind that these numbers are based on ad revenue alone as most big YouTubers sell merch do brand deals and way more!
    <br><br><span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>When we know this we can get started&downarrow;.</strong></span>
    
    </p>
    <br>    <br>
    <h2><strong>World's Richest YouTubers in 2022</strong></h2>
    <h3>
        <strong>   KSI </strong>
    </h3>    <br>
    <p>
        Recording hip hops along the way he picked up vlogging and even had a boxing match with American YouTuber Logan Paul earning an estimated $11 million. KSI casually bought a gold iPhone 10 while walking around the mall in Dubai. That's chump change compared to some of the massive purchases these UK YouTubers made in March of 2019 $500,000, custom-made chain modeled after the Dragon Ball Super character furious the chain contains over 2000 stones it's 550 hours of craftsmanship. 
    <br><br>From his two channels, KSI likely makes between<strong> $1.2 and $3.2 million annually.
    </strong>
    </p>
    <br>    <br>
    <h3>
     <strong> Logan Paul</strong>  
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        One of the most controversial YouTubers in the world started recording for youtube at age of 24. After that started doing everything from starring in movies to hosting a YouTuber Olympics having the number one podcast in the world and the largest non-professional boxing match in history. Logan has proven himself to be an incredibly resourceful businessman and his hard work is more than paid off the American
    <br><br> YouTuber lives in a gorgeous $6.6 million man Encino CA with seven bedrooms a full gym and a huge podcasting studio inside. The number one podcast in the world can also put $225,000 into converting a regular old yellow school bus into his signature cool bus while he has a ton of money coming in.
    <br><br>From brand deals touring and his hugely popular maverick merch. Logan Paul's channel likely brings in between<strong> $666,000 and $1.8 million a year.
    </strong>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>
        <strong>  Jake Paul</strong>
      
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        The younger brother of logan paul jake paul made a name for himself. His channel grew from nothing to 5,000,000 subscribers in a matter of six months. A feat that at the time had never been done before. American YouTuber shows that he's branched out from YouTube into getting paid the big bucks for speaking engagements at massive business conventions around the world. Combine that with his hugely popular music career and wildly successful merge lines Jake Paul is pulling in the big.  Jake has a liking for buying nice cars such as his $132,000 Tesla Model X and $350,000 Lamborghini Oricon are the crown jewels in his prize collection while most of his money comes in through his merch line.
    <br><br>His YouTube channel brings from <strong>$3milion up to $3.4 million a year. 
    <br><br>Who's the Big Brother now?</strong>
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3><strong>Jacksepticeye</strong></h3><br>
    <p>

With a massive audience of nearly 23 million subscribers and counting frequently collaborates with the other big gamers of the famous trio Markiplier and PewDiePie. Generous Irishman doesn't like to spend his money to flex and prefers to use his influence to raise money for various charities raising billions of dollars over the years. He helps mental health awareness by providing clean water to third-world countries and famously raising $225,000 for the American foundation for suicide prevention during a single eight-hour charity live stream.

    <br><br>
    <h3><strong>Dan TDM</strong></h3><br>
    <p>
        Dan TDM has become a pillar of YouTube since starting his channel.

    <br><br>Today our most accurate data shows that the British gamer brings in between <strong></strong>3.4 and $9.1 billion annually from his YouTube channel.</strong>
    
    </p>

        Slovakian vlogger is a respectable 13.2 million subscriber channel. David lives in a $2.5 million mansion in Los Angeles which he says is not too big not too small not too modern and not too old perfectly balanced as all things should be except for that price.
    <br><br>David doesn't just use his millions to spoil himself though and famously prefers to spend it to make his friends happy. Then record their reactions and post them on YouTube to make it back. So far he's bought 15 of his friends brand new cars as well as highly sought-after Hamilton tickets which obviously might be worth more than some of those cars.
    <br><br>This channel brings in between<strong> 4.8 and $13 million a year</strong> All in all is living proof that dreams do come true.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3><strong>  Dude Perfect  </strong></h3><br>

    <h3><strong>PewDiePie</strong></h3><br>
    <p>The king of YouTube Felix Schulberg also known as PewDiePie.We place him on top of our list of World's Richest YouTubers in 2022. Has held the spot of most subscribed YouTuber for more than half a decade. I don't count corporations in one amazing week in August 2019 when he became the first person to pass 100 million subscribers. This year he married his longtime girlfriend Marcia and beat the ender dragon in Minecraft. Money and fame haven't changed Felix much because he lives in a humble house in Brighton England and drives an average car.
      <strong> <br><br> YouTuber called an estimate of his net worth of $40 million </strong>a little low. This channel pulls in millions of views frequently at the top of the trending page although not so much in America for some reason.
