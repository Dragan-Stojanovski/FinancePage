    </p>
    <p>
      In 2022, TikTok has evolved and changed. It is no longer a social network where teenagers sing and dance. It has turned into a platform that contains all kinds of content, from a full day of eating up to a day in the life of a doctor or astronaut.
    <br><br>
    It is for these reasons that TikTok achieved its success. Any type of content can succeed on this social network. While on Facebook and Twitter you are quite limited in your creativity.
