      <h3>Choose right topic
    
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing you need to do is to choose a topic on which you will write and have high expertise on that topic so that your blogs are relevant to visitors. The biggest mistake of most bloggers is that they choose a topic that earns the best but they have no knowledge of it. After they soon realize that because their content is of poor quality, their blog is losing visitors.
    
    
    
      </p>
      <br>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>
          The key to a good topic is to have high expertise in it, if your readers notice that you do not have needed expertise in a certain topic then reading your blogs will be a waste of their time.
        </p>
      </div>
        <br>
        <h3>The right name for your blog</h3>
    
        <p>Although some underestimate the value that a good name gives to your blog. First and foremost you need to find a name that describes what information your users will find on your blog. Also, think about how your name will fit in your URL address, and social networks because once you start branding your domain it's hard to change everything.
    
        </p>
          <br>
          <div class="quote">
        <p>
          When choosing a name for your blog, it must contain a term that explains your business, as well as be easy to pronounce and remember.
    
        </p>
      </div>
    <br>
    <h3>
      Create a website
    
    </h3>
    <p>To begin with blogging first reserve a domain and hosting for your website where it will be attached to the Internet. Our recommendation is to create your website in WordPress, which is free and easy to use with effortless plugins for easy management of your website.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>For more information on using WordPress if you are a beginner, you can refer to our <a href="WordPress_for_beginners.html">Beginner's WordPress guide.</a>
    <br><br>
    If you are creating it yourself, take the time to familiarize yourself with the platform on which you will create your site, and if you hire a developer, make sure that he will be there for you if there are certain problems with the site.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Guide to your blog content.
    </h3>
         
          <p>
            After you have created your site on which you will blog and upload it to the Internet. Now it remains to enter content that will give value to your site. Without quality content, your site does not offer any value to your users. There are basic rules when creating content for your blog. Perhaps the most important thing in creating content for your site is to be SEO (Search Engine Optimization) optimized. For that, you will have to familiarize yourself at least with the basics of SEO or hire a professional agency or an SEO consultant who will help with the optimization of your blog.
    <br>
    
    <br>
    <strong>
      Fundamentally, you must extract a keyword through which your users will come to your website.
    
    </strong>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Your content must contain the basic elements of a blog post:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Headline-</strong>The first thing that will attract users.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Introduction to the contents-</strong>Familiarizes users with what to expect.</li>
                <li><strong>Subheadings-</strong>Divide the text into wholes and further entice users to continue reading.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Photos-</strong>Photos are easier to follow than text and will capture more easily what a particular piece of text is about.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Links-</strong>Link your texts if they are of a similar theme.</li>
    
              </ul>
