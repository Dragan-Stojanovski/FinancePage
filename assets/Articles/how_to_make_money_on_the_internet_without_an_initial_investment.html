    <p>If you want to earn money online, read this blog post, where we will present 6 ways to earn money online without initial investment!
    </p>
    <p>
        With the help of these ways of earning money on the Internet. I managed to reach financial freedom working from home. It took me 10 months to get my first income because I did not know how to earn money. I experienced many scams that are promoted on the Internet, but nothing help me, I just wasted my time.
    <br><br>Like every young teenager who wanted to start earning money on the Internet. I searched on Google every day how to start earning money on the Internet, but everything that was offered to me required a certain amount of money to be invested to start making some money (if it starts!).
    <br><br>The most important thing in my opinion is that a person offers quality and knowledge and "does not sell fog". After all, you can try it and see how it goes, but I'm sure you won't regret it.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>First, let's clarify</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>There is no way to get fast money on the Internet, if someone promises you to earn easy money, feel free to slap him because he is trying to deceive you.
        </li>
        <li>To start making money is not possible overnight. Making money on the Internet is similar to dividing the land into two worlds, you plant more, invest, and then wait for a certain period to pass so that you can reap the fruits of your work.
        </li>
        <li>If you want quick easy money then the internet is not for you. Try your hand at politics or crime, you might earn something easy.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h3>If you are ready to put effort into work then:</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Be ready to constantly learn new skills
        </li>
        <li>You have to be patient, you need to work for at least 3 to 6 months to get your first income.
        </li>
        <li>And you must have basic equipment to work on the Internet: <br>
            -Personal PC or laptop<br>
            -Gmail account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Internet is a miracle of the 21st century, as long as you have a laptop computer, a smartphone, and an Internet connection, you can earn money online.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>
    How to start making money online?
    </h2><br>
    <p>
        Nowadays, there are countless ways to make money online, but it's crazy to be skeptical about this type of income, especially for the older generation.
    <br><br>One of the main reasons why people expect instant earnings the same day they create their website should be aware that working on the Internet is a marathon, not a sprint.
    <br><br>I know from my own experience that it is not easy to invest time, effort, energy, and knowledge and not get anything in return, but on the Internet, things are like that, put up with it and be patient, and it will pay off!
    <br><br>But in one moment when you will get your first income, even if it is small, the feeling is indescribable.
    <br><br>If you are a beginner and you want to be successful on the Internet, you have to be patient and persistent, even if you don't see the results, but be aware that great rewards are obtained only after great suffering and risks.
    <br><br>Also, many people fail to make money on the Internet, and it is mostly because they succumb to a scam where they are promised easy money. After they finish work and are not paid, they realize that it is better to get 1 hard-earned dollar than empty promises of towers and cities.
    <br><br>When you start working on the internet you have no knowledge and experience you are an easy target for scammers on the internet looking for their next victim. Be aware that there is no easy money anywhere in any field, to earn you have to work to contribute in some way to the world whether it's physical work or you've written a post that helps a lot of people as I do for example.
    <br><br>Before you start earning money online, you should have basic skills and knowledge about what you want to do. If you don't have the necessary skills, devote a certain period to acquiring at least basic knowledge, then by working and gaining experience you will bring your newly acquired knowledge to perfection.

    <h2>
        Is it at all possible to earn money on the Internet without investment?
    </h2><br>
    <p>
        It can indeed be earned, but it is more difficult.
        <br><br>You must know that from these jobs that I will talk about below, you will not be able to afford a vacation or winter vacation, loan repayment, or monthly bill payments. To save or save nice money from working on the Internet, you will have to invest in yourself! (I mean money of course)
        <br><br>When I say invest in yourself, I primarily mean education, training, and even mentorship.
        <br><br>The jobs I'm talking about can be used by everyone, unemployed, high school students, students, old, young, absolutely anyone.
        <br><br>There are many ways to make money online, but I warn you to beware of scammers who just want to take your money. Earning on the Internet overnight is not possible (unfortunately), it takes time to see results.
        <br><br>The fact that we all need extra money is abused by fraudsters on the Internet promising easy earnings with minimal effort, but to get those earnings, they ask you to pay them for certain software or a course of theirs from which you will not profit in any way.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>A few things that you should be aware of and keep in mind all the time.</h3>
    <br><p>
        It is hard to come by a legitimate reliable way to earn money online because scammers have flooded the internet because it provides them with anonymity. They can simply use a certain nickname while scamming you so that when you are scammed they are gone and you have no one to fall back on turn.
    
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be аwary of any sites that ask you for a registration fee before you get a job or ask for your personal information.
        </li>
        <li>Watch out for websites that take advantage of your work skills but won't pay you enough in compensation.
        </li>
        <li>A great way to avoid such fake websites and companies is to thoroughly research any website and read the reviews and comments people have left about it.
        </li>
        <li>Always remember to read the contract they offer you before signing.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Earning money online gives you flexibility with your working hours, which is why it is the perfect way to earn money for students who are limited by time due to preparing for exams.
    <br><br>Or if you have a job, then you can earn something extra on the side by devoting a few hours a week.
    <br><br><strong>Let's move on to earnings...</strong>
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>. Blogging - you write content and earn passive income (OUR RECOMMENDATION).
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        Blogging is my favorite way to make money on the Internet, next to these I already run blog sites dedicated to making money in online adventures, and gambling.
        <br><br>This is the cleanest way to earn money on the Internet, by just writing about your experiences or writing on a topic that you are relevant to so that people want to read what you write.
        <br><br>You can earn money on the Internet with a minimal investment to start your blog will cost no more than $100 and then it's up to you to create content for your site.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>
        2. Article Writing Services 
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        Did you know that blogging is one of the most lucrative and popular ways to earn money on the Internet today, both in our country and in the world? Every day at least about 3000 blogs are created which is a really big number.
        <br><br>Bloggers are always looking for people to write articles for them. I have my writer who writes for me, although sometimes I write an article myself (such as this one).
        <br><br>You don't have to be an expert in writing, each of us can provide writing services, it's just important to have patience and will. For each written article, you can be paid from $5 to $12, although the price depends on the quality of the article, the length, the area you write about, etc.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>3. Become a Freelancer</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I guess many of you have heard about freelancing, but did you know that it is also one of the most popular ways to earn money where you don't need an initial investment?
       <br><br> If you have a degree and no job, freelancing is the right solution for you. It doesn't matter if you are a developer, decorator, painter, photographer, or something else, you can make money as a freelancer.
       <br><br>  A freelancer is a self-employed person, he can work when he wants and as much as he wants, but of course, the earnings depend on the work invested. What I especially like about freelancing is that you don't have a boss over your head.
        </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>
        4. Earn With The Help Of PTC Sites (Not Recommended)
    
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        This is a real way to earn a second income working on the Internet. PTC stands for “Paid To Click” which means that you will earn money by clicking on ads and advertisements. Of course, you need to register on verified and secure sites because the internet is full of "scammers" who only want your money.
        <br><br>Earnings from PTC sites are not very big, but it is more than realistic to earn up to 200 euros per month.
        <br><br>To earn money with the help of PTC sites, you need to click on an advertisement and after the advertisement expires, you will be paid a certain number of dollars.
        <br><br>This way of earning does not require any experience or investment, but it requires time to start earning more.
        <br><br>In order to make maximum profit from PTC sites, it is desirable to "bring" new members to the sites by promoting the site through the link they give you.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>
        5. Throw yourself into Instagram
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        I guess we all already know about that famous Instagram. I honestly don't know a person who doesn't have an Instagram profile today. What most people do is "waste" their time surfing Instagram without actually knowing that they can make serious money as an Instagram Influencer.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>
        6. Do Online Surveys
    </h3><br>
    <p>
        This is another great opportunity where people can earn every day by completing surveys. A large number of companies ask questions (surveys) about their products and want to hear the opinions of users to gather different answers and suggestions.
        <br><br>Filling out surveys will take 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the length of the survey and the company. All you have to do is say what you think and write feedback.
        <br><br>As for this type of online business, you can earn from $1 to $20 per survey, it all depends on the length of the survey, your profile, and the country you live in.
