    <p>
      Many experts on making money online say that we can't make money playing video games, that we're wasting our time and energy, and that we should get away from it.
  <br>But professional players know that they can earn big money in tournaments, similar to professional sports.
  
  </p>
  <p>
      This is because they are not familiar with the gaming industry and its business potential in how many ways you can monetize your skills acquired in a particular game.
  <br><br>That's why we decided to share with you the top 8 ways to make money playing video games. Before we start, let us tell you that you can earn very well from gaming, but don't limit your source of income to just one place besides gaming, you will have a lot of time and energy to devote to many other things, for example, I run this blog and at the same time I work full-time as a full-stack developer which is my passion and the blog is my hobby, I write because I want to and it brings me good passive income.
  
  </p>
  <br> <br>
  <h2>1. Be a professional player
  </h2> <br>
  <p>
      The number one way to make money from playing video games is to become a professional player. If you are good at a game you train and improve your skills every day. Then a professional gaming career is the right choice for you.
      <br><br> E-gaming tournaments at the moment have grown to be serious organizations where the rewards reach several millions of $.
      <br><br>And some will say that there is no money in gaming!
      <br><br> If you are not ready for huge tournaments where the top 1 percent of all players compete to prove them selfs and earn money. You can start by signing up for small local tournaments where you are rewarded with a small amount of money, but the experience you will gain is priceless.
      <br><br>Big e-tournaments like the League of Legends Dota 2 or Counter Strike Global offensive attract a big audience and even bigger paydays for the winners.

  <h3>
      2. You start blogging
  
  </h3> <br>
  <p>
      The second way you can monetize your knowledge in video games is quite simple and we highly recommend it, and that is to start a blog or a website dedicated to the gaming world, you can write reviews for certain games, guides, and tricks to make it easier to pass a certain game 
      <br><br>Make something that people will want to read and google and look to be the first in your niche when it pops up post it don't wait for someone to do it before you.
      <br><br>It's simple, start your own blog site, after a certain period has passed and you start earning, you can hire someone to write the content for you and this has the potential to slowly grow into a serious business model.
      <br><br>After 6 months to a year of active blogging, you start bringing traffic to your website and it's time to get paid for your work and effort. You can do this through AdSense, affiliate marketing, or selling advertising space. Although it sounds complicated, believe me, once you come to good traffic on your site, companies will come and offer you money for ads or banners, so don't worry about that.

  <h3>
      3. Start recording for YouTube
  
  </h3> <br>
  <p>
      Idea number 3 is youtube which is an abnormal source of earning money for gamers you can record everything from commenting on certain game reviews up to gameplay, where you don't speak or show your face you simply record your screen while playing and upload it on youtube.
  <br><br>The main way of monetizing your YouTube channel is through Google AdSense. This means that after you get 1000 subscribers and over 4000 hours of views on your videos, you are eligible to become a Google partner and show ads on your channel after that. For each click on an ad that YouTube displays on your video, you receive a certain monetary compensation.

  <h4>Video game YouTubers combine AdSense with a few more ways to increase their income.
  </h4> <br>
  <ul>
      <li>Affiliate marketing.
      </li>
      <li>Brand partnerships and sponsorships.
      </li>
      <li>Viewer support and donations.
      </li>
      <li>Merchandise and product sales.
      </li>
  </ul>
  <br> <br>
  <h3>
      4. Clipping of videos
  </h3> <br>
  <p>
      High school students make a lot of money by clipping long videos from popular gamers. Let's clarify what clipping of other people's clips means. It means that you take the best moments of gameplay of another YouTuber who has a gameplay of 3 hours, let's say you make this video and you compose a new video that will last 10 minutes with the most exciting parts of those 3 hours.
   <br><br>It sounds great but you should be aware that you must not make video clips without the owner's permission. If you do that you are violating their property rights. Culturally contact the owner of the video and ask him to permit you to clip their video.

  <br> <br>
  <h3>
      5. Streaming on Trovo and Twitch
  </h3> <br>
  <p>
      Trovo pays a lot of money to people who record videos, although lately, it is more complicated. In the beginning, it was a boom, huge money was earned by recording for Trovo, and a good part of YouTubers came to a monthly income of 5,000 to 10,000 euros per month for recording on Trovo.
  <br><br>The following line is similar to recording on Trovo but it's about streaming on Twitter and YouTube although they have a lot of similarities to Trovo and twitch however for twitch you have to promote yourself on TikTok Instagram and YouTube to gather an audience that will follow you and then invite them to come to watch your streams and if they like them and enjoy the content you create they will donate a certain amount of money to support what you do.
  <br><br><strong>Top streamers make 6- and even 7-figures a year!</strong>

  <br>  <br><h3>
      6. Become a professional coach 
  </h3> <br>
  <p>
      Video game coaching is a great option if you have a deep understanding and passion for specific games.
  <br><br>As in other sports where coaches earn a good amount of money, there is an opportunity to earn as a coach in the gaming industry. To be relevant for players to want to pay for your services as a coach, you must be a proven expert in the game you want to coach. Several ways to prove yourself is to participate in a pro tournament where everyone will have a chance to see your skills, you can also write an e-book to look more serious for example you play LOL you can write an e-book on how to climb your rank faster, etc.
  <br><br>Once you prove yourself and become relevant in the game you play you can apply to platforms that offer such services and it pays well from $10 to $50 per hour depending on your expertise.
  
  </p>
  <br> <br>
  <h3>
      7. Boosting accounts
  </h3> <br>
  <p>
      It means that you are a good player and someone else who is not so good but wants to have a higher rank in the game pays you to play instead of him and raises the rank of his account.
  <br><br>For example, if you play league of legends professionally you have reached a high skill level. Someone who is stuck in bronze can hire you and pay you $50 to $100 to boost their rank to silver that is good money and for a good player, this is one day's work and sweet money.

  <br> <br>
  <h3>
      8. Write (or publish) guides and explanations for games
  </h3> <br>
  <p>
      A lot of newbies like to know how to get that special weapon or the easiest ways to take down that boss, so this can be a very lucrative way to make money.
      <br><br>First of all, anyone can write a tutorial of some kind (or they can record it on YouTube and later post it on their YouTube page). Again, what you want is for your guides to be viewed or read the most. In order to achieve this, you again need effort and patience. There is nothing without effort and patience. You need to "know how to write".
      <br><br>This means that your style should be recognizable, that you should recognize its charm, and that "something" that will make you stand out from the crowd of other competitors.
