    <p>Many companies were not ready that they would have to accept their employees to work from home, so the companies do not have maximum control over what the employees do. Companies were not ready for this change.
      <br><br>
      We are already successful in this field, we have been working from home on the Internet for 7 years, at the beginning we had problems, we became lazy in the comfort of our homes. For those reasons, we are making this guide that will help you to see working from home as a real job and not sitting in pajamas in front of the computer with a cup of coffee. We will help you figure out how to work from home and how to make a border between work and private life.
      
    
     </p>
     <br><br>
     <h3>
      1. Planned working hours
      </h3><br>
      <p>
        A lot depends on whether you work for a company or you are a YouTuber blogger. Where you determine when, where, with whom you will work, and how much. If you are employed by a company as a programmer or graphic designer, you will work from home, but you will already have a specific job time from the company you work for. You will have no problems, the start, break, and end of your working hours will be planned.
    
    <br><br>
        If you have the privilege of working on the internet for yourself to be your boss. Then you can have a problem with working hours because of the complete freedom and flexibility to work when you want as much as you want, you can become lazy. To prevent that from happening, organize your work at a time that you will respect, a precisely defined start and end of working hours, regularly planned breaks, and not depending on how much you work, this will significantly increase your productivity.
    
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>2. Morning routine</h3>
      <br><p>
      One of the characteristics of every successful person is a morning routine, a clearly defined routine that is repeated every morning and has been shown to be useful. This routine is different for everyone, for some it is a run for another cold shower while someone likes to read a book as soon as they wake up and on that way to start the day. You can't go wrong with planning a morning routine, the only wrong morning routine is a routine that doesn't exist. Decide for yourself what will help you start the day productively, we prefer walking and listening to an audiobook. Find what wakes you up and apply it!
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>
      3. Set boundaries for people around you
    
    </h3>
    <br><p>
      Set clear rules for the people you share the space with while you work. If you have children, make it clear to them what they can and cannot do. If you have a roommate or girlfriend, you will have to agree with them not to disturb you while you work with loud music or any distractions.
    <br><br>
      If you do not get understanding from the people you share the space with while you work. You will have serious problems with your work and significantly reduced productivity. Many people, especially the older generations, cannot understand that we work and earn money on the Internet. We do not play games while sitting in front of our monitors.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>
      4. Jump out of your house
    </h3>
    <p>
      This advice is not only valid for those who work from home on the Internet, but this advice is also important for those who work in the office. Your body needs movement and the development of circulation, even though you work for money online. Consider it as work, when you are done, jump out take a walk stretch, breathe fresh air get natural light your body needs vitamin D. Try to work from different environments go to a cafe work from there for a few hours, go to a park go to the beach Almost every park or beach has an internet connection you will have no problem working from there.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>5. Don't be afraid to take sick leave
    </h3>
    <p>
      Because you work from home on the Internet, don't lie to yourself that even when you're not feeling well, you should continue working. If you work for yourself and not for a company, you don't have paid sick leave, that will scare you, and because of that many times even when you're not you feel good, you will continue to work. You should be aware that your health and productivity will improve significantly if you take a few days off to recover.
    <br><br>
      You are already aware that your health has no price, so don't lie to yourself that if you rest for a few days you will get poorer.

    <h2>
      Pros and Cons of Working from Home
    </h2><br>
    <h3>Pros of Working From Home</h3>
    <p>
      1.Remote workers are significantly less stressed than workers who work in an office under the supervision of superiors. With remote workers, the focus on work is significantly greater, which makes them significantly more productive, this means a lot to you especially if you work for yourself.
    <br><br>2.There is no daily unnecessary communication with your colleagues, drinking coffee, or aimlessly smoking cigarettes. Although it sounds harsh, communicating with your colleagues in the office is fun, but it distracts you from work, and work is what you came for. So one of the advantages of working from home is that in the room is you a cup of coffee and your work.
    <br><br>3.Remote workers have the flexibility they have unfettered flexibility especially if they work for themselves. In most cases, it is important to finish the work during the day when it does not matter which gives workers the freedom to choose what time they start work when they take a break and when their working time ends. Which is one of the biggest advantages of remote workers known as flexible working hours.

    <h3>
      Cons of Working From Home
    </h3><br>
    <p>
      1. Working from home can make you feel lonely, you will have more focus on work, but for people who want companionship, working from home is not the best option.
    <br><br>2. Cooperation with a team can become a challenge. Due to the fact that your only way of communication will be texting and video calls, the organization in the team will be significantly more difficult for you.
    <br><br>3. It's challenging to have a good work-from-home culture many good workers get lazy. When they start working from home they relax some people just love the office work atmosphere and wouldn't change it.
