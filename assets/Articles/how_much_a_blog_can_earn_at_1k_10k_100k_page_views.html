   <strong> Today we are talking about how much a website can earn at 1000 page views a month, 10,000 page views a month and 100,000 page views a month.<br><br> Reason we wanted to make this post is because it's so hard to answer that question because obviously, the answer is it depends. We have a friend who has 10,000 page views only and is earning  $10.000 a month, but that's unheard of. In order to be able to earn that much from that few paid views.<br><br>But it can be done if you nail the monetization.
  </strong> 

  </p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  Choose the right blogging niche
</h2> 
<br>
<p>
  We're gonna break it down into different categories because the monetization changes as you add more volume to it, so we'll talk about it in these different categories but just know that there's a huge <strong> IT DEPENDS</strong> on this whole post. I'm gonna explain the factors that make up those differences as we go through.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
  Blog earnings from 1.000 page views!
</h2>
<br>
<p>
  Let's start with a website with 1000 page views. Here I would expect about 7 bucks a month you know maybe you make $2 a month from AdSense, AdSense from Google is easy to put on a website but it just doesn't earn a whole lot per thousand visitors and it's just never gonna be realy big. With only 1000 page views it's hard for an advertiser even to figure out who your audience is.<br><br> <strong>At that point so $2 there and then $5 just from linking to Amazon for Amazon affiliate just cause it's quick and easy to set up. So at 1.000 page views you can expect some pizza money. it's exciting to see some progress but that's all you'll probably be doing there.</strong>

<h2>
  Blog earnings from 10.000 page views!
</h2>
<p>
  Let's talk about the 10,000 page view month mark now we're starting to get serious. If a website can get to 10,000 page views it will get to 100.000 page views. You've learned what kind of content resonates with people and you just need to add volume to it. So 10,000 page views is an exciting time for a website here I would expect a $9 RPM probably go with Ezoic for monetizing your site by publishing ads.<br><br>

They are still probably the best option for a low page view website at 10,000 most of the premium ads networks won't take you yet, so he's probably your best bet here and we see RPM that's revenue per mile or how much you earn from putting ads on your website per 1.000 page views. Anywhere from $3 to over $20 on Ezoic most of those end up you know between that $7 to $10 range on at least in my personal experience. So we are earning way better than signing for Google AdSense.<br><br>

it's a great option for starting out and then affiliates we're gonna say it's $240 per month. To earn this amount of money is not difficult to do to get to that $240. if we're talking about looking at more creative affiliate deals and not just linking to random crap on Amazon and hoping for success. I think it needs to be a major piece of your earnings here so with 10,000 page views we're gonna expect $330 per month.

  Blog earnings from 100.000 page views!
</h2>
<p>
  Let's talk about 100,000 page views but before we get there I just wanna say that getting to 100.00 views is serious work effort and accomplishment CONGRATS.<br><br>

This is where I feel like you have a real business that's gonna make a monthly income impact in just about anybody's finances unless you're like Elon Mask or something like that.<br><br>

<strong>Alright so with 100,000 page views you'll earn around $5000 per month.</strong><br><br>

Where will that income come from we're hoping that you'll be on a premium ads network you know media vine and add arrived at drive is our favorite and at this point, we're gonna expect an RPM of about $20 per 1.000 page views?<br><br>

You're gonna start seeing some exciting RPM, especially in the fourth quarter, the reason it does better is marketing strategy of companies.<br><br> I can't just tease that the reason that they do better in the fourth quarter is that companies save their ad spend for Christmas and New Year.Then affiliate I would expect from 1500 to $2000 from an affiliate in many general niches but that's really because you've had a little bit of time to start optimizing the affiliate and so you may be there if you had time to optimize affiliate way better and get deep into affilate marketing, you could do three or four times that.<br><br>

The cool thing at 100,000 page views is you have so much volume and so many people coming through then you can run a test almost every day. To start optimizing, we'll see you take your 50 top posts with the most traffic and you go put one affiliate program in all 50 of those posts, then you write it down.<br><br>

It may only take two days before you have enough volume to know if it was a statistically significant improvement over what you had before then you go to the next program if you take some time to optimize it you can go hard on affiliate income it just takes some practice and time to get there .<br><br> With that volume, you can iterate quickly,  if you only have 1000 page views a month it's just taking forever to run any kind of test. Well we're also gonna add affiliate income which we will put as $1000 per month here, but you can dominate with an affiliate if you do it right.<br><br>

I have a story of a friend to share he has fewer than 1000 e-mail subscribers and 1500 subscribers on Instagram and just did a $12,000 when he launched his info product that is so cool so you know he's getting just 60 people to pay $200 for that info product and that's 12 grand just from that one product. Really depends on that do you have the right product to put in front of them at the right price and if you push it appropriately it takes some practice to launch an info product but when you get the recipe right it can just be awesome.

I'm gonna want you to do an info product it's usually our biggest earner is info products. So we put it as $1000 per month here but it just depends on how well you do with it learning to monetize your site is a process of trial and error.<br><br> It takes a lot of trial and error to figure out how to get the traffic and then it takes more trial and error to figure out how to monetize it we've done it over a dozen times building different dot coms from scratch up to success and earning significant money.<br><br> Because of that experience we've put everything into a step by step process sharing with you the very best things we've learned and doing that to get to success at all and to get to it as quickly as possible
