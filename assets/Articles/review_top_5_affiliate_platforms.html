<h2>What Is Affiliate Marketing And How Does It Work?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Simply put, Affiliate Marketing is one of the most profitable ways to make money online.
<br><br>Affiliate marketing is one of the oldest forms of digital marketing in which you refer someone to any product or service and when that person buys a certain product based on your recommendation, you get a percentage of the sale.
<br><br>Percentages can range from $1 to $10,000, depending on the product you are promoting. So if I work for the company "NOKIA", that is, I promote Nokia phones, everyone who buys a phone from me will earn a percentage, whether it will be 5%, 10% or 50%, it depends exclusively on the company you work for.

    </p>
<br><br>
<h2>Here's how affiliate marketing works in 4 simple steps:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Register in the affiliate program - (Company "Nokia" in my case)
    </li>
    <li>Select the product you want to promote – (Mobile phone in your case)
    </li>
    <li>Share your personal (affiliate) LINK on your blog, Facebook, YouTube, forums, or anywhere there are active visitors.
    </li>
    <li>When someone buys a certain product through YOUR link, you get a percentage.
    </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h2>Advantages Of Affiliate Marketing (Blogging)
</h2>
<br>
<p>
    I must mention that the advantages are unlimited, but I will list the ones that are my favorites and that I enjoy:
</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>You don't have a boss above your head - this is the "dream" of many people, imagine working for yourself and having no one next to you who will command you what and how much to do.</li>
    <li>More time for yourself and your loved ones (my favorite!) – when was the last time you went to the sea? Do you have any free days or holidays at all? I know that I didn't have when I was working for a private company, I work from morning to night and every day even on weekends. With affiliate marketing, you will have more time for yourself and your family.</li>
    <li>Earnings are unlimited – Affiliate marketing has no fixed earnings, you can earn from $0 to infinity, the point is that the more effort you put in, the more you will profit, in short, and clearly. I have to emphasize again that this is PASSIVE income, which means that when you enter something, you will earn money even when you sleep.</li>
    
</ul>

<p>We've spent the past 90 days testing the biggest affiliate platforms here <strong>Our Review On Best Affilate Platforms.</strong></p>
<br><br>
<h3><a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/home">Amazon Associates</a></h3>
<br>
<p>
    Everyone has ordered something through Amazon or at least we have a friend who has. Amazon is one of the world's best-standing retailers in which its customers have maximum trust. That's why it's really easy to convince your readers to buy a certain product through your affiliate link.
    <br><br>Amazon offers you a huge selection of products to promote. It has more than 350 million products in its warehouses, selling almost everything. Even if your niche is specific, Amazon probably has something you can offer your readers.
    <br><br>Amazon ships to more than 10 countries around the world which gives you a huge opportunity to expand your business.

</p>
<br><br>
<h4>What Is The Amazon Associates Program?</h4>
<br>
<p>Amazon Associates is an affiliate marketing program through which anyone with an online audience — website owners, affiliate bloggers, social media influencers — can create links and earn referral fees when someone clicks those links and buys a product from an Amazon site.
 <br><br>   It’s one of the largest affiliate programs on the planet.
 <br><br>   Like the vast majority of other affiliate programs, it’s totally free to join.
 <br><br>  And it’s pretty easy to use:
 <br><br> Just create your Amazon affiliate links, write quality content to promote a product (or products) on Amazon, and you’ll earn money for every purchase.
 <br><br> To make your job easier still, Amazon runs regular retail promotions — things like fixed discounts and free shipping offers — designed to help affiliate marketers drive traffic.
    </p>
<br><br>
<h4>How much you can earn from the Amazon affiliate program?
</h4>
<br>
<img src="../img/amazon_earnings.png" width="100%" alt="amazon_commisions">
<br>
<div class="quote">
    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <p>
        Those commissions change all the time, so please don’t launch an affiliate website based solely on the rates in that screenshot. In fact, commission rates shouldn’t be any sort of deciding factor in finding the right niche. Instead, choose a niche that a) you actually enjoy and b) has lots of growth potential.
  
    </p>
</div>
    <br>
    <h4>Payment</h4>
    <p>
        Commission income are paid by direct deposit approximately 60 days after the end of the month for which they are being paid.
        <br><br>Expamle:
        <br><br>Payment for January is made in late March.
        <br><br>Payment for June is made in late August.

    </p>
<br><br><br>
<h3><a href="https://www.refersion.com/">Refersion</a></h3>
<br>
<p>
    Refersion is an affiliate management solution that helps you grow sales. It offers affiliate sign-up forms and a place to design different types of offers. You can also calculate commissions and track affiliate sales per conversion.
<br><br>Refersion works on the concept of offers. The offers also act as a group of affiliates that belong to the same commission structure. After creating offers, you then start inviting affiliates.
<br><br>Each offer is tied to a unique registration page and there are two ways to share it. You can embed the form directly on your website. On the other hand, Refersion provides a unique share URL that you could email to an affiliate.
<br><br>The affiliate will be able to log in to their dashboard once you approve their application.

</p>
<br><br>
<h4>How Refersion pays out</h4>
<br>
<p>
    Refersion provides two ways to pay commissions owed to affiliates. For starters, it has a PayPal integration that makes it easy to pay affiliates with one click of a button.
<br><br>Secondly, you can pay affiliates using the Gift Card option. It sends gift card emails to your affiliates in your backend and marks the affiliate as paid.

<h3><a href="https://www.shareasale.com/info/">ShareASale</a></h3>
<br>
<p>
    If you've been in affiliate marketing for a while, you've probably heard of ShareASale.
    <br><br>I have a wealth of experience with ShareASale that I will share with you.
    <br><br>I chose this affiliate network because there are a huge number of merchants that you can choose from and a good number of them will automatically approve you. This means you will immediately be able to start promoting the product you have chosen.
    <br><br>The variety of products is huge from software, online courses, furniture, technology, etc.
    <br><br>Literally, the multitudes are huge, so no matter what niche you are in, you will find something that will suit your visitors.

</p>
<br><br>
<h4>How to track your results</h4>
<br>
<p>
    ShareASale gives you a link through which your visitors can go to the page of a certain product and buy it.
<br><br> These links contain cookies that are installed in the client's browser. Cookies have a duration of 30 to 90 days. This means that if your visitor clicks on the link and doesn't buy the product immediately, there is still a chance, depending on the cookies if he returns to the product and buys it in the next 30 to 90 days depending on the product, you will still be paid a commission by the percentage that the product has.

</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<h4>Payment Methods</h4>
