    NFTs are quite popular among people as an investment nowadays. While looking for investments to make, you will take a look at NFTs as well. If you invested in NFTs in last year, you could have got amazing returns. But are you too late now to invest in NFTs? 
<br><br>Let’s deep dive and figure out the trends and risks associated with NFT investments as of now. Based on that, you can come to a decision on whether to proceed with NFT investments or not.
 </p>
<br><br>
<h2>What exactly is an NFT? </h2>
<br>
<p>
    Before taking a look at NFT investments, you will need to figure out what exactly an NFT is all about. NFTs, which are also known as Non-Fungible Tokens are the unique data strings, which are stored inside a blockchain. In most instances, NFTs are stored within the Ethereum blockchain. 
    <br><br>It is possible to store many different types of data in the data strings on a blockchain. Medical records and legal documents are to name a few. However, the concept of NFTs became quite popular when people started using the data strings for the storage of digital artwork. 
    <br><br>When a specific digital artwork is living on a website, it is possible to copy and paste that along with impunity. But when the digital artwork is uploaded into the blockchain in the form of a NFT, it can only exist as one. Therefore, all NFTs are original. This is the main reason on why there is a massive demand for NFTs among collectors out there.
    <br><br>You can find few platforms that sell digital artwork in the blockchain for people who wish to invest in them. OpenSea is a perfect example for such a marketplace. When you purchase digital art from OpenSea, you will be able to get that added into the crypto wallet. However, you will not be getting anything tangible along with your purchase. You will not even be able to get the copyright. You can just be the owner of the digital art. 
    <br><br>You can simply consider NFT as ownership certificates available for digital art. They are available within the Blockchain. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
    How to buy and sell NFTs?  
</h2>
<br>
<p>
    Now you have a basic idea on what NFTs are all about. While keeping that in mind, let’s learn more on how to buy and sell NFTs. You can usually buy or sell NFTs on the internet. This is where you may use a cryptocurrency for making the purchase. Regardless of how old NFTs are, they became extremely popular among people in the year 2021. There is a high demand for using NFTs in order to purchase and trade different artworks. Due to the same reason, worldwide NFT market could reach $25 billion within the year as well.
    <br><br>You can consider the process of purchasing NFT art as an excellent investment. That’s because the collectors will be able to add something valuable into their collections. Along with that, they can have bragging rights about the product that they purchased. There is an in-built method available to verify the authentication of NFTs. It provides extra value to the NFTs as well.
    <br><br>It is also important to keep in mind that NFTs are not just artwork available out there. Collectors and gamers out there will be able to have their NFTs as well. All they have to do is to transform unique assets, such as in-game objects into NFTs. By doing that, it would be possible for them to create an excellent source of making money.
</p>
<br><br>
<div class="marked-part">
<h3>Risks associated with investing in NFTs </h3>
<br>
<p>
    Even though NFTs were so popular among people in 2021, they aren’t in their peak popularity as of now. Therefore, you would wonder what would happen to your NFT investments in 2023. 
</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<h3>Its not easy to make a fortune with NFTs in 2023 </h3>
<br>
<p>Back in 2021, and even in early 2022, you could make a fortune with NFTs. However, things have changed significantly along with time. As of now, it would not be so easy for you to make a fortune with NFTs. 
    <br><br> You will not just be able to randomly buy NFTs and make profits. As you shop around for NFTs in marketplaces, you will notice that some of them are priced too low whereas others are priced too high. This is where you need to understand that the overall price associated with NFTs vary based on their demands. However, it is also possible for the price to be inflated artificially through unethical or unlawful methods. 
    <br><br> For example, some people sell and buy NFTs from their own fake accounts, just to create a fake demand. Then the price associated with the NFT will increase. You should be careful not to go ahead and buy such NFTs. You can even buy a NFT for $100 and sell it on your second account for $1,000. However, this doesn’t mean that the original value associated with the NFT becomes $1,000. This overall process is known as wash trading, and you should be careful not to fall into it.
    <br><br> Since more and more people are getting to know about this trick, we don’t see any major inflation in the NFT market as of now. Therefore, some of the trucks that you could use to make a fortune with NFTs will not be possible anymore. As this has created a lack of interest in NFTs, you cannot expect to make a great income as you could back in the days. Hence, you should think twice before you invest in NFTs.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>NFTs are better for the environment </h3>
<br>
<p>
    Some of the most popular businessmen who have been backing NFTs now seem to have negative thoughts about it. For example, Elon Musk now says that NFTs are NFTs are harmful for the environment. These comments make people lose their interest in investing in NFTs. You should also keep that in the back of your mind as you proceed with your NFT investments. 
    <br><br>The blockchain services are notorious for consuming lots of energy. That’s because computers need to be up and running throughout in order to support all the transactions. This will contribute a lot towards the CO2 emissions. Even though we will not experience the effects of it in short run, we will probably have to experience long-term effects. As responsible citizens, we should not be supporting things that contribute towards CO2 emissions. This is another reason on why you shouldn’t be taking a look at NFT investments in 2023. 
    <br><br>If people stop supporting NFTs, there would not be any demand for the digital art stored in blockchains. As a result, digital art would just be another piece of art. Imagine what would happen if you spent $10,000 to purchase a digital art but loses all its value by the next year. If you don’t want to take any such risks with an investment, you will need to think twice before you invest money. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Ownership of NFTs can be volatile </h3>
<br>
<p>
    The idea of purchasing NFTs with the objective of generating profits can be a great idea to consider as of now. However, will you be able to retain the ownership of the specific NFT that you purchased in the long run? This can be quite a tricky question to answer.
    <br><br>Once you purchase a NFT, a smart contract will be assigned to you on the blockchain. This smart contract would clearly define that you are the owner of the mentioned digital asset. But the digital asset would not be on the computer. It would be on another person’s computer. For example, it can be on Coinbase. Imagine what would happen if Coinbase decides to stop all their operations and shut down. Then what would happen to your ownership? This would eventually lead you to ownership disputes. 
    <br><br>According to latest news that we can see in the crypto world, it is possible to see that NFTs would be available soon in the form of decentralized services. Once this is available, the overall game would change a bit. However, we have a long way to go to achieve it. Therefore, we cannot expect that things would change by the year 2023. If you have plans to invest in NFTs in 2023 or before that, you should be willing to bear this risk. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>You can easily be scammed with NFTs </h3>
<br>
<p>
    We can already see how a lot of scams are taking place out there in the NFT world. This is another risk that you should be mindful about. Most of these scams are taking place in popular NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea, Binance NFT, and Coinbase. 
    <br><br>When you go ahead and invest your money in a NFT, there is a possibility for a seller to send a fake copy of the artwork. You might assume it to be an original copy. This might lead you to losing thousands of dollars in the long run as well. 
    <br><br>All the transactions that you do on the blockchain are kind of irreversible. If you fall for a scam, there is no possibility to raise a dispute and get back your money. Therefore, you will just have to throw away your money in vain. Along with time, we can see how these scams are becoming more prominent along with time as well. In 2023, you may have to deal with many such scams. Therefore, it is important for you to be mindful about such scams and make sure that you don’t lose all the money you invest. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h4>How can you invest in NFTS? </h4>
<br>
<p>
    Since you now know a lot about NFTs, let’s take a quick look at the process that you should follow in order to invest your money in NFTs. You just need to be aware about the basics at the time of investing in NFTs. Then you can get amazing returns that NFT investments can deliver you in the long run. 
</p>
<br>
<div class="marked-part">
<ul>
    <li>You need to first create your crypto wallet. Then you will have to proceed with buying cryptocurrency. Since NFTS are usually on the Ethereum Blockchain, we strongly encourage you to get your hands on some Ether to proceed with.</li>
    <li>Next, you need to take a look at the different NFT marketplaces that you can find out there. OpenSea.io is the most popular NFT marketplace that you can find out there. However, you should not just limit your research to it. You may also focus on the other NFT marketplaces such as Mintable, Axie, and Nifty Gateway. </li>
    <li>The third step would be to look around for NFTs that you are looking forward to buying from the NFT marketplace. </li>
    <li>As the last step of buying, you may go ahead and bit on the NFTs that you are willing to buy. Based on your bid, you can end up with getting hold of the NFTs. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<p>
    When you are investing in the NFTs, you should also be mindful about the concept named gas fees. For every transaction that you do on the Ether blockchain, there is a transaction fee, which is known as the gas fee. You will need to pay this gas fee in order to complete a transaction.
    <br><br>In case if the gas fee is too high, you would want to wait for some time, so that other buyers have ended up spending more on gas fees than what they actually spent on the NFT inset.
    <br><br>It is also possible for anyone to proceed with investing on NFTs via the venture capital funds. But if you are willing to go ahead with this path, you should first become an accredited investor. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Final Words</h4>

<p>Even though the idea of getting into NFT investments in 2023 can be appealing, there are some risks that you will have to undertake as well. We strongly encourage you to take a look at these risks and make sure that you deal with them accordingly. Then you can end up with getting the most out of your NFT investments while minimizing risk. </p>
