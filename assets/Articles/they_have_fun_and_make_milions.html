      Top-earning gamers are more influential than elite athletes. They earn millions using the fact that millions follow them on social platforms, with the help of which they make various sponsorships.<strong>THEY HAVE FUN AND MAKE MILLIONS</strong>
  </p>
  <p>In the world of professional gamers, winning is not everything. Richard Tyler, better known as "Ninja", earned $17 million last year, which is enough to take first place on Forbes' list of the highest-paid gamers. However, this 28-year-old professional has earned less than $100,000 by competing, most of his earnings come from streaming and sponsor deals.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Below you can see the top five highest-paid gamers and their earnings</h2>
  <br>  <br>
  <h3>1. Richard Tyler Ninja</h3>  <br>  <br>
  <h4><strong>Earnings - 17 million dollars</strong>
  </h4>  <br>
  <p>
      Who would have thought that games could pay off like this...
      <br>  <br>  If you are a gamer and if you play the most popular game in the world, Fortnite, then you surely know who Ninja Tyler Blevins is. This guy started his career 10 years ago when he was a professional Halo player, but now he found his popularity on Twitch and Youtube. Although Fortnite is the game he plays the most, he also started playing the latest Battle Royale game, Apex Legends, for which he won an incredible amount of money.
      <br>  <br>  Ninja has 2.8 million followers on Mixer, Microsoft's home gaming platform. The blonde gamer has an additional 22.7 million YouTube subscribers and 14.9 million Instagram followers. In total, the ten highest-earning gamers have 270 million followers across YouTube, Twitch, and Mixer and earned $121 million last year.
      <br>  <br>  Ninja's face adorned a can of a soft drink, food products... Adidas has Ninja sneakers. The Ninja Wardrobe can be purchased at Walmart and Target. At his peak, this guy was making $500,000 a month.
      <br>  <br>  The EA company, which created this game, paid Ninja a million dollars just for one day to play it and advertise it on Twitch and YouTube platforms.
      
  </p>
  <br>  <br>
  <h3>2. PewDiePie, Felix Kjellberg</h3>  <br>  <br>
  <h4><strong>Earnings - 15 million dollars
  </strong>
  </h4>  <br>
  <p>
      He is one of the "most followed" people on the Internet, which brought him a huge income. For example, in September 2017, PewDiePie had 57 million followers on YouTube.
      <br>  <br>During his work on YouTube, Ojudipay created content that many praised as original, but also very often considered controversial.
      <br>  <br>As a result of a controversy in early 2017 related to accusations of anti-Semitism in several of Pudipay's videos, Disney's Maker Studios cut ties with him, dropping him from their network. Although he criticized the media's coverage of the situation and defended his content as jokes taken out of context, he ultimately acknowledged its offensiveness.
