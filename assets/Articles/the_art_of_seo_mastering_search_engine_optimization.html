    <h2>Okay, so what exactly is SEO optimization?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    Simply put, you want to be first on Google, or at least among the first. For this to happen, you must:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Research keywords (topics you want to rank for)</li>
    <li>You create a lot of quality content (like this blog post you're reading)</li>
    <li>You attract a lot of quality links (from other sites) to your site</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <br>That is the simplest explanation. But each of these 3 is a "science in itself", and they form the main parts of SEO optimization.
    <strong>There are a million texts on this topic, a lot of materials, courses, and it is not difficult to get lost.</strong> Especially since SEO is constantly changing. Certain principles remain the same, but there is always something new, every year, that is more important (more influential on the ranking) than last year. Google improves (and changes) its ranking algorithm every day, on the basis of which it decides which site will take which position.
    <br><br>But these 3 things I listed for you (research, creation, links) are the crux of the story and they were the same 10 years ago, and will probably be 10 years from now.
    <br><br>However, due to the huge amount of contradictory information, the question is whether you are ready to do this on your own, or whether you want to hire an SEO optimization agency or an SEO expert-consultant when your traffic growth "slows down" and you need a specialist to unblock the problem.
    <br><br>However, it is good to understand the whole process so that no one can deceive you. Because you should hire an expert to optimize your web site. You must have at least a basic knowledge to know what is going on.
    <br><br><strong>The art of seo mastering search engine optimization </strong>
    </p><br><br>
    <h2>If you are thinking of boosting your website</h2>
    <h4>This is what you should be aware of </h4>
    <br>
    <p>
    <strong>SEO is half science half art.</strong> No one is 100% sure, because things are constantly changing and Google doesn't tell you 100% everything "on the spot", but you have to break through practice. There are certain "best practices" that the industry follows, but many have different opinions about this topic.
    <br><br><strong>Among "Engines", the main player is Google.</strong> Other search engines (Yahoo and Bing) are almost completely irrelevant. And, usually if you are the first on Google, you are mostly the first on Bing (they are "owned" by Microsoft) and Yahoo, because they usually copy Google.
    <br><br>Local stores used to be an important location, but today "retail" shops are slowly dying. In America, shopping malls are becoming ghost towns. People order everything online from comfort of their houses, fruit and vegetables and bunch of other goods, not just books and clothes.
    <br><br>Today, you can have a physical branch in the middle of nowhere, and people will still come to your shop if they found you on Google before.
    <br><br>So today, SEO optimization is something like CREATING a location on the Internet. You can't just "rent" that space, you have to get to the location with work, creativity, and persistent investment of money, time, and energy: a complete mix.
    <br><br><strong> What is important is that it is not fast — because if it is "fast", run! </strong>There must be something wrong if it's eazy and fast.  
    <br><br>
    SEO is a slow process. A slow and painstaking process. There is nothing to rush. Not can anything be 100% guaranteed in terms of the exact position on Google or the exact time you will reach it. What can be guaranteed is some sort of assessment of progress based on market weight, competition, etc. There are easier markets, with easier competition, and tough markets, where all your competition is investing in SEO optimization and Content Marketing (because they understand the value).
    <br><br>
    The fact that SEO is a (continuous) process is also why many businesses are skeptical. They want instant results, they want "security", greater certainty. This is possible if they pay for visits through AdWords or Facebook. Another problem is impatience, they won't wait 6-12 months before the investment starts gradually returning to them. So that's where the problem arises of either excessive, unrealistic expectations, or getting into something that you don't have the capacity to push through to the end.
    <br><br>So look at SEO like running a marathon, not a sprint.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Better a little at a time, but in the long run, than to rush in.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    View SEO as a long-term investment, as an important part of a complete marketing strategy, which is a continuous process. SEO activities start when you start your business and end when you sell it.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>What does Google want and what does it have to do with SEO?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    Search is Google's core product. They offer solutions to problems. The ability to find solutions is what keeps people coming back to Google and why they use it. It brings them money.
    <br><br>Their product is that people who have a certain problem and come to Google to search, Google will show the best result for their search. That's why people come back to Google, because when they search for something, <strong>Google is the fastest and easiest way to find what they were looking for</strong>.
    <br><br>
    <strong>That's why Google is looking for a partner in you and your site</strong>, that you have specific content that solves the problems of their users. The partner who best solves search questions is the one whom Google rewards with more recommendations, through the highest positions in the search.
    <br><br>SEO optimization of the site is therefore a collaboration, without a contract, between you ie. your site, and Google...which acts as an intermediary between you and the searcher.
    <br><br>
    How does Google make money there? One of the main ways is that you can also pay to be "first" on Google by advertising in Google's paid ads. Their product is called AdWords, or Google Ads. That's another topic, but that's how Google makes money — they charge companies for advertising space.
    <br><br>
    <strong>For many, paid ads are a better and faster solution,</strong> but not everyone can advertise through paid ads (there are a lot of rules and restrictions), and not everyone is profitable. Sometimes a click is very expensive.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Criteriums for ranking on Google</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    This is done by SEO experts or SEO optimization agencies. They try to "decipher" what Google wants and how best to present and position your site. No one knows 100% exactly how Google's algorithm works because Google won't reveal everything. Not because Google's competition will steal it, but because, if 100% exactly what influences the search result the most is publicly available, then various "webmasters" (site owners) would abuse it. They would "hack" the algorithm.
    <br><br>
    So Google will never give away 100% of its formula, its ranking algorithm. There are experienced SEO agencies that optimize one, the second, the third, the hundredth site, and maintain those sites, monitor the parameters, monitor whether the positions improve or not. It is, as if someone is maintaining the "health" of the site, and health is measured in flow, ie. the number of visits you receive based on Google recommending you. Agencies or experts constantly monitor what exactly is happening, what changes and novelties Google has announced.
    
    <br><br>Google often announces when they "release" some change in the algorithm, they also say what they<strong> don't like and what they like,</strong> and there are a lot of things that are "safe" in the sense that it is generally known that certain parameters are good and others not so much.
    
    <br><br>Where there is a lot of controversy when it comes to SEO optimization is what helps more and what helps a little less. So, what are the priorities...what is the strategy, the system, which will be used to reach the destination.
    
    <br><br>Google results are a living market.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Is there negative SEO?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    There's also something called negative SEO, that's when the competition pays these same people that Google doesn't like, "spammers", and it's usually some Pakistani, who posts a bunch of "dubious" links, so that Google thinks YOU are "cheating" ” algorithm while in fact they are setting you up. It's like someone giving Nadal a doping test. By the time he explains to the World Tennis Federation what is going on and how they framed him... DONE. A year goes by, the titles go. That is why you must always watch with a watchful eye, install "cameras", perform protection and complete monitoring, cleaning. Fast defense and constant strengthening of your position, so that even a tornado can't do anything to you.
    </p>	
    <br><br>
    <h3>Key factors of seo optimization</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Let's dive deeper into The art of seo mastering search engine optimization </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Do thorough keyword research</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    The first thing to do (and what an SEO agency should do if you hire one), is to do thorough market research. An agency that asks you "what do you want to rank for" or "date" on Google is not doing a good job.
    
    <br><br>It's not the point that you know. From the start, you can only guess what your potential customers are "typing" into Google, but it is the job of an SEO agency to research in detail what all the relevant keywords are for your market.
    <br><br>What you or the agency should do is a complete and detailed market research and all relevant keywords to get the complete picture. Each keyword is its own competition. You may find a keyword that is less "typed", but for which it is easier to rank because there is less competition.
    
    <br><br>If you have a NEW site, you will often be fighting in the ring with sites that have been around for a long time and have positioned themselves better. Google values ​​sites that have existed longer and whose domain has been registered for a longer period of time. Because that means you're here and you're staying. You are a better partner. More reliable.
    <br><br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>How is keyword research done right?</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
    In order to do a thorough job, agencies usually use a variety of SOFTWARE that pull data from various sources. These softwares cost anywhere from $10 to $1,000 per month. It depends on how advanced it is. Access to those software draws various data, from what your competition is doing, how many visits they have, and where they get links to their site, to the fact that they can precisely see the number of searches for certain keywords and what are the real chances of your site ranking.
    <br><br>
    The smart thing is to get a trial version of all these software (just don't forget to turn off before you charge), and use up all the data in the 30 days that the trial period usually lasts. You have about 10 or so great softwares that you can change every month and thus have access for free.
    <br><br>It's a good option when you only have one site. And of course if you know excellent English.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Create a "Content Marketing" strategy or plan</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    It is one thing to know "what are your keywords", and another is what you will write on the site.
    <br><br>In this world of digital marketing, there are a couple of popular phrases, one of which is "content is king".
    <br><br>The site is a skeleton, and it is very important, of course, that it is done properly and designed with the aim of selling well. But without good content, without "meat", it is still only a skeleton, which does not perform its task.
    <br><br>It's always better to have good content and a bad site than a good site and bad content. It is also of course best to have the best of everything.
    <br><br>But that's why it's important to invest in good content and value it at least as much as you value a good website. Good SEO optimization implies a strategic consideration of content. Because it is not enough to know the keywords, but also what content to "stick" to them.
    <br><br>It is much easier to find good keywords than to create good content. Unfortunately, hardly anyone deals with it because they don't understand the real POWER of good content.
    <br><br>Now, the problem is that you can't just create content for Google's ROBOTS, you have to create content for PEOPLE first and foremost. People will read, click, call, buy.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3> Arrange good content writers </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    Since writing is not for everyone, nor should it be. Just as not everyone knows how to unclog a sewer by themselves (nor will they), so writing is a craft. Which is paid in the rest of the world.
    
    <br><br>Words sell. The story of sales. And the SEO STORY, it both sells and attracts visits. It is not easy to find writers who write well and understand the basics of SEO optimization of each text, but you can guide them in this, or you can subsequently optimize the texts independently.
    
    <br><br>In most cases, you are busy, and it is easier to let someone who is a professional writer, or at least very good at researching content, write the texts ie. creates good content for you.
    
    <br><br>Prices range from free to 30 euros, depending on the quality of the text, the experience of the writer, how well they know the topic so they need less time to research and write, and your guesswork.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Do a good "on-page" SEO optimization of the site  </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    SEO has a lot of important technical parts that are usually called "on-page". The thing is, there are hundreds of factors that affect your position on Google. It's just a matter of control. What you can and cannot influence. Basically, you can influence almost anything, but the question is how much real influence you have. Thus, SEO tasks are divided into off-page and on-page.
    
    <br><br>On-page is something you have far more control over. Just as you have more control over how you see yourself than how others see you. On-page is your site and all the technical aspects that you can polish so that they are "tip top" and that Google likes you more.
    
    <br><br>Part of on-page optimization is, for example, site speed. The faster the site, the less users struggle. The clearer the site, the better connected, etc. the easier it is for users to find the information they are looking for. For example, if you have a site that is cluttered with advertisements, it is not a good user experience, therefore you have done poor on-page optimization and you will rank lower. Likewise, if the site is too slow, you will rank poorly.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Install Google Analytics  </h3>
    
    <p>
    <br><br>Google Analytics is a staple of every website. It is a free tool that Google makes available to webmasters. It actually serves as a spy tool for Google to better assess whether you are a good partner or not.
    
    <br><br>The most basic function of Google Analytics is to know "how many visits you have". But that's not all.
    
    <br><br>Google Analytics also tells you where visitors come from, from which city, from which devices they come (mobile, tablet or computer), and even exactly from which mobile device. How long they stayed on the site, which pages they opened, which landing page they came through, and with the optimization of Google Analytics you can also measure conversions.
    
    <br><br>Anyway, Google Analytics is site analytics, you see everything. Follow the results through it. You can also see live at any moment how many people are on the site, and where they came from. Whether from Google, from Facebook, on a "recommendation" from another site through a link, or perhaps via email. You can see almost everything, analyze it, and adjust your strategy accordingly.
    
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Optimize the site for mobile devices</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    Now maybe 70% of your visits will come from mobile devices (Google Analytics will tell you the exact percentage), so primarily for the sake of the user, the site must be optimized, i.e. adapted for all mobile devices. The site must look as good or better on mobile than on desktop.
    <br><br>Remember Google's basic business philosophy — they want happy users. They will not be sent to a site where they have to struggle, "widen" the screen and simply cannot quickly and easily find a solution to their problem.
    <br><br>Again, this will not be done by an SEO optimization agency, but must be resolved with your developer and designer.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Publish as many relevant articles as possible</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    I won't go into detail about this, but the more, the better the content, the better and the higher the chances of ranking. What is important is that you have a focused site that deals with one specific topic in as much detail as possible. With a focused site, you will rank faster and easier than with a general site that covers a little bit of all topics. Google likes specialized sites that are an authority on a certain topic.
    <br><br>The more, the better content helps you rank and position yourself as an expert in your field. This is what attracts links (referrals), the MAIN signal that Google takes into account. Links are signals above all other signals. But to attract them, you need to have the best content, and as much content as possible.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3> Give as much value as you can for free</h3>
    <br>
    <p> This is not logical at first glance, but in fact it is.
    
    <strong>You might be thinking, "but if I give them everything for free, what would they pay me for?"</strong>, and what does this have to do with SEO optimization?
    
    <br><br>Well, there is, and how. Google searches the Internet using links. The more, the "stronger" and the more relevant links there are to your site (and main pages), from other sites (which are relevant), the better you are ranked. Google sees every link to you as a recommendation.
    
    <br><br>The more value you provide for free on the site, the better resource you become. It's naturally you become more attractive for people to recommend you. What on their websites, what on social networks, likes, shares. Google calculates all of this somewhere and the complete "mix" of signals on the basis of which it decides. </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3> 
    Build a Network of Associates — The Secret Ingredient of SEO Agencies</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    This is the "secret ingredient" of SEO optimization.
    
    This is actually what gets the results — referrals that is. links from other sites. At the same time this is both poison and elixir. Two-edged sword.
    
    <br><br>You want to have as many "follow" links to your site as possible. You can "earn" them by having great content and people will naturally recommend you, or you can try to buy them.
    
    <br><br>Google prohibits buying links because it is a way to manipulate the algorithm. What some do for "quick results" is to buy a large number of low-quality, non-relevant links from bad sites. For example, a domestic insurance company may have unknowingly hired some "Indians" who bought thousands of Chinese links from various Chinese websites and "empty pages". That will work for a while, until they come tumbling down like a house of cards.
    
    <br><br>Such links are usually bought "in bulk", like wholesale, so you don't buy one link, but a hundred, and these are usually links in the sidebar (on the side) or in the footer (at the bottom) of the page, these are the so-called "site-wide" links. The problem is that when a site has 10,000 pages, you have 10,000 links to you. Google sees it all as an attempt to manipulate the algorithm until it spills over. They see that it is not natural. And lupe penalty. So they completely delete you from Google. You disappear, completely.
    
    <br><br>On the other hand, you can "ethically" build links by building relationships with other webmasters one by one, ie. site owners. You call them, check if they are willing to cooperate. Provided their content is relevant to yours. A good SEO agency has a wide network of contacts, or let's say "good connections" with other website owners. Hundreds or thousands of good contacts with real sites that are also of good quality and have good content and a good "link profile". So you don't want bad sites that cheat the system linking to your site. You only want to work with vetted people. You can build the network yourself. It's a process and a job. Coffee, contacts, emails, calls. Those relationships are built over years.

    <h3>Find a way to earn links</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    
    You can also earn links for free by investing in amazing linkable content.
    
    <br><br>In order for people to link to your site, you need to create a good referral-worthy resource.
    
    <br><br>The best way to do this is to integrate your SEO marketing with Facebook. You'll create good content that's useful to as many people as possible, as wide a spectrum as possible, and then promote that content massively on Facebook. It costs money, but it's how you push your content initially. If you have already invested money in creating good content, you should also promote it a little. Give him a fair chance. So maybe you will get something back.
